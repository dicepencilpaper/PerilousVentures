## Foreword

Tabletop role-playing games are the only type of game that give you total freedom of action. Of course, that freedom is regulated by a ruleset that provides the limits and constraints of the fantasy world you are playing in; otherwise, it would be just playing pretend.

Those rulesets can become quite complicated; after all, trying to copy real-life actions and events, and providing as much flexibility as possible for the players usually brings in a lot of mechanisms for judging and determining results in an impartial manner.

This can make preparing and starting a game a rather tedious process that requires looking at endless charts and choosing among dozens of options just to create a character to play. Add to that an extensive set of guidelines and rules to run the game, and it can become a difficult task.

Little by little, the game is not that fun anymore; playing becomes a bit of a chore.

This is what motivated me to create Perilous Ventures. I strived to create a system where set up from the players and the game master was minimal. A system where a group of friends can get a brand-new adventure started in less than 15 minutes, and yet still be able to provide a balanced system that allows for solid combat and storytelling.

This book is the product of years of experimentation and prototyping diverse systems, from incredibly sparse to overly complicated. I think this one hits the nail on the head with the right balance, of course, leaning heavily towards being lithe, agile, and quick.

Not only is _Perilous Ventures_ light and fast, it’s also expandable, as everything in the game is made in a building-block style, allowing players and game masters to come up with their own races, classes, and character backgrounds. The possibilities are endless.

Thank you for acquiring this game. Your support means a lot to me. I hope this role-playing game provides you with endless hours of fun.

_Kick open the door, fight the monsters, get the gold, and as a side quest… Save your world!_

## Creating a character

So you want to be in this fantastic and dangerous world? Welcome, future adventurer, you will have a great time! We will have a character created very quickly, and you will be ready to play in no time. Character creation is quite simplified and you can definitely have the basic definition for your character in less than five minutes.

If you’re planning to participate as a Game Master and want to read more about the mechanics and how to run the game, you can skip to the section Running the Game, where it explains all these things in detail.

However, even if you are planning to be the Game Master, it’s important that you understand how player characters are made, since the same mechanisms apply to non-player characters (NPCs).

In this game, race and class options are limited, with clear and specific advantages to each one. We keep these roles clearly sharp and well defined, which makes it easy for players to establish how they intend to delve into the adventure.

All you need to create your character is the following items:

* A few six-sided dice (d6), about four or five is a good amount.
* Blank ruled paper.
* Pencil and eraser.
* This book!

### Character creation steps

#### Select a race

Your character’s race will determine certain bonuses or disadvantages that you will have for your character. However, the importance of race goes beyond that, as it also can become a huge element in the role-playing part of your character and help define their personality and backstory.

#### Select a class

The character’s class determines their profession. Do you want to be a fearless sword-wielder? Do you want to control arcane powers? Think of what you want from your character, and how you want to approach the adventure. Each class provides special abilities and advantages that do not exist in other character classes, and sometimes, some disadvantages. Like everything, it is all a matter of compromise.

#### Choose magic fields (optional)

If you select a spellcasting class like priest of wizard, you must select one or more magic fields for your character. Spells belong to certain arcane areas depending on what they manipulate, and these areas are called magic fields.

#### Choose backgrounds

Backgrounds are part of your character’s backstory, and help define your character’s capabilities in matters that go beyond combat situations. Is your character good at negotiation? Will it be able to repair a piece of armor? Can it survive in the wilderness? Your choice of backgrounds defines this.

#### Get money & equipment

Choose any weapons and armor that the character will use in the adventure. Note that some classes have limitations in terms of which weapons and armor they can use. Make sure to pick things your character will be able to use. Also, do not forget adventuring gear; it is not all about weapons and armor. The player character will need tools to help them explore the world.

#### Name and describe your character

Now think of who this person is, its name, personality traits, and some brief backstory ideas you can think up. Alternatively, simply give it a name and let the game session define it! This can be a fun, simple approach that ends up with colorful, interesting characters.

## Defininf your character

Player characters in this system have no ability scores as usually defined by other RPG systems, such as strength or intelligence scores. Instead, modifiers provided by the race, class, and background selections made by the player in the character creation process define the characteristics and features of the player character.

Grab a sheet of paper and a pencil, and write down the information for your new adventurer. At the top of the sheet, leave a space for each of the following items: Name, Race, and Class.

### Action rolls

There are four basic action dice rolls for determining combat results: two opposed rolls for attacks with weapons (melee, missile, or unarmed), and two opposed rolls for magical attacks.

The score of each one of these rolls is equal to how many dice you will be rolling when executing the action. All characters start with 1 six-sided die as their base roll. So write down the rolls (explained below), in a list format, and write “1” (your base roll for each action) beside each score, similar to this:

Combat |
-------|---
PA     | 1
PD     | 1
MA     | 1
MD     | 1

Here’s a quick explanation of these action rolls and how they are used in gameplay.

#### Physical Action (PA)

This action dice roll is for when a character strikes with a physical weapon (either melee, missile, or an unarmed strike), and it's also used for moves and actions that might not be easy to perform and will require a check, like somersaulting over a fence while being pursued.

#### Physical Defense (PD)

The target of a physical attack performs this action roll to compete against the attack roll and avoid receiving damage. It can also be used for things like being freed out of a grappling move, or avoid being hit by a tumbling rock.

#### Mental Action (MA)

Spells are ultimately controlled by the caster's mental strength. This is the action roll used by spell casters to determine their success when utilizing spells. Any player characters, regardless of their class, that use magical devices such as staves or wands also perform this action roll. This roll is also used to determine mental acumen and perception.

#### Mental Defense (MD)

Being that magic is controlled from the spellcaster's mind, avoiding magical damage also is based on the target's mental prowess. This is the action roll made by the target of a magical strike, whether from a spell or a magical device, to avoid receiving damage. Note that for magical weapons, you must use Physical Defense as your defense action roll. This action roll is also used for avoiding being tricked.

### Damage

You need to keep a tally of the damage received during combat. On another section of the page, write down the following base stats related to damage. Write down a label, “Damage”, and below that write down the information explained below.

#### Hero Points (HP)

All characters start with a base of 4 hero points. So, below the “Damage” title, write down “HP: 4”. Hero points account for a mixture of resistance to combat fatigue and your character’s willfulness to push forward in combat in spite of being hurt. As your character exerts themselves in combat, your stamina and ability to withstand minor hits diminishes, and this is reflected through a diminishing hero point count. However, even after losing all your hero points, your character can still keep on fighting.

#### Life Points (LP)

All characters start with 2 life points. You start counting off these points in two situations: when your character’s hero points reach zero, or when you have a lethal hit, meaning that your opponent rolled a 6 on a successful attack roll. Once a character runs out of life points, they are unconscious and dying. Below “HP: 4”, write down “LP: 2”.

#### Death Points (DP)

Death points are used when the character is unconscious and dying after receiving enough damage to run out of life points. Characters will always have an amount of death points equal to their life points, therefore, below your life point score, write down “DP: 2”.

## RACES

Next step is to choose a race for our character. As standard option, there are four classic fantasy races available for player characters: dwarf, elf, halfling, and human. However, we have also included simple guidelines for creating a character for another race, if you wish to do so.

### Race modifiers

Choosing a race gives you an advantage, called a boost, in a particular dice roll. A boost, as the name implies, adds an extra die to your rolls, greatly increasing the chances for success when rolling for that particular action. Details on how this works are in the section titled _The ORC Engine._

If the race shows that you get a boost on any of the action rolls (PA, PD, and so forth), make sure to write down “+1” besides that particular roll, at the right of the pre-written “1” on your character sheet.

Your character’s race can also modify how many hero points your character has. If the chosen race increases or decreases your hero point amount, make sure to change the number you’ve written down in the Damage section.

### Backgrounds

There are suggested backgrounds that are deemed appropriate for each particular race. These are just guidelines, as you can select whichever backgrounds you prefer for your character. Details about backgrounds and how they work is found in the Backgrounds section below.

### Dwarf

Dwarves are strong, stocky folk, with a penchant for strong drink & hard work. They are usually about four to four and a half feet tall, although a few unique individuals can reach five feet in stature. Dwarves usually live to about 170 years old, and some reach 200 years of life.

They excel at fighting due to their innate physical strength and their centuries-old warfare traditions and defender of the dwarven kingdoms, therefore all dwarves get 1 boost on Physical Action (PA).

Suggested backgrounds for dwarves are Metalworking or Stonemason.

Dwarven society’s base is the clan, which is defined and named by whoever was the founding member of a settlement. These settlements are heavily walled and defended, and an incursion into a dwarven settlement is usually seen as a foolhardy enterprise.

Dwarves were originally created by the deities of Change and Preservation, Ambius and Aja, respectively. This reflects on their abilities and desire to change the world by building things, and their fierce attitude towards defending those in need and preserving traditions.

### Elf

Elves are lithe, graceful, beautiful creatures, with beautiful almond-shaped eyes, large pointed ears, and slim but muscular bodies. They usually are around five to five and a half feet in height. They live very long lives, with some elves surpassing the 300 year old mark.

Elven society is defined by gens, which is a group with a similar culture and origin. Each gen has their own domain, or elvendom. These domains are usually well-guarded, although some gens are more welcoming of other races and species.

The elves were created by Erra, Element goddess, and Mosferi, god of the Ethereal. This is demonstrated by the elves affinity to the physical universe and nature, and their highly spiritual approach to life. For this reason, they have a strong natural inclination to the magical and natural worlds, and get 1 boost on Mental Attack (MA) action rolls.

Suggested backgrounds for elf characters are Crafting or Survivalist.

### Halfling

Halflings are happy-go-lucky people, tiny in size but huge in courage and outstandingly nimble by nature, for which they get 1 boost on Physical Defense (PD). They are small and slender, with the tallest of halflings being no more than 3 and a half feet in height.

Due to their nature, halflings could have a Traveler or Entertainer background. They live up to an average of 100 years of age, and some surpass 120 years.

They are wanderers and nomads, and such, they have no permanent settlements in the world. However, some halfling tribes have established semi-permanent settlements in certain parts of the world, but these are not as organized as a city or town. Every tribe is led by a boss, who handles all the final decisions the tribe makes together with some of the eldest members.

Halflings are a creation of the mischievous god of Deceit, Ruco, and this is demonstrated by their tendency to be sneaky, tricky and furtive. Ruco created them together with Erda, god of Truth, which explains why halflings are friendly, open, brash, and blatantly honest.

### Human

They are the most populous race, reliable, resilient and versatile, and this natural toughness grants humans 1 boost on Mental Defense (MD) rolls. Humans have no recommended background choices due to their diversity and for having spread to literally all corners of the world.

Like modern humans, they usually live to 85 years of age, but some have surpassed that, living for more than 120 years of age.

They are the most versatile of all races, and as such can be found organized in anything ranging from primitive tribes to huge walled cities.

Humans were the first creation of the gods, and are the joint effort of Vid, god of Life, and Muer, goddess of Death. This is demonstrated by their intense love of life and the world they live in, and their acceptance and infliction of death unto others throughout history.

### Playing other races

It might be that you are interested in playing a character from a race different from the ones shown here. This system is flexible enough to allow for something like that, and it is easy to do so. Here are two ways you can use to create a race for your player character.

#### Use an existing race as a template

Take the race that you want to play and compare it with the existing ones, then pick the one whose boosts and hero point modifiers are more similar to what you have in mind.

For example, if you wanted to play a goblin, using a halfling as the base would make sense, since they are both small and agile. You might want to change the background depending on your concept of goblins. However, assuming that most goblins live in the wild in almost barbarian-like tribes, a background of Survival or Naturalist would probably fit well.

#### Create a race or species from scratch

As an option, you could try create a brand-new race not based on an existing one. In its most basic form, you will need to set up three elements for it:

1. **Combat roll boost** - If desired, choose only one roll to boost: Physical Action, Physical Defense, Magical Attack or Mental Defense.

2. **Default backgrounds** - This is where you can get much more freedom, but also can become a bit more involving. Think up a couple of backgrounds that could fit this new race. They do not even have to be in the background list presented in this book.

3. **Divine background** - Optionally, you can also define their divine background. Which deity or deities created this race? How does that influence their nature?

As always, regardless of which path you choose for your new race, make sure to discuss it with your Game Master! You have to agree upon it and confirm that it will fit the game style and world you will be playing in.

## CLASSES

There are four character classes available for player characters: priest, thief, warrior, and wizard. Each class provides its own advantages and disadvantages, and are designed to complement each other during adventures.

Any class-related action roll boosts need to be written down. As we did with the race descriptions, write down your chosen class boost beside the score as a “+1”. If it happens that the class you chose has a boost in a roll you already have a boost for, simply write the +1 beside the previous one, as boosts do stack up.

Classes can modify the life points available to your character. Don’t forget to increase or decrease this score if needed, and the related death point score, as they’re always equal.

### Action points

Each character class has a pool of Action Points (AP) available. These points are used differently on each character class; for warriors and thieves, they are used to perform special combat maneuvers. For priests and wizards, it determines their spellcasting capacity.

All player characters start off with 6 action points regardless of race or class. Below the Damage section of your sheet, write down “Action Points: 6”.

As action points fluctuate during combat actions, you might find that adding and subtracting them on paper might not be as easy as you would like. An easy way to keep track of your current AP is to use a d6 as a counter as it goes up and down. Tokens can be used too, anything from game pieces to pennies.

### Backgrounds

There are suggested backgrounds that are deemed appropriate for each particular character class. However, these are just guidelines, as you can select whichever backgrounds you prefer for your character.

### Priest

Priests are divine warriors that fight in the name of one or more divine beings. They defend their deities’ goals and purpose for the world, and they can be good or evil.

A priest gets 1 boost on Mental Defense (MD). They can cast spells, although their casting abilities are less diverse than those of wizards. Priests can use magical items, one-handed weapons, and can wear armor but not shields.

#### Background

A priest character could choose among the following suggested backgrounds:

*   Clergy
*   Scholar
*   Noble adviser
*   Revolutionary

#### Magic field

As a devoted servant of a single deity, a priest must choose only one magic field. This field reflects the character’s chosen deity and that deity’s purpose for the world. This means that magic field selection goes beyond a simple game choice, as it affects the character’s role-play in relation to its deity. You can read a description of the available magic fields and their deities in the _Magic & Spells_ section below.

It is rare but possible that, through some life crisis or other special situation that provokes a change of allegiance, a priest can change deities. In such a case, the priest would immediately gain the magic field from the chosen deity, and forget how to cast spells in the previous field.

##### Effects on magic item use

If a priest uses a magical device that belongs to their selected magic field, they gain 1 boost when using it. Similarly, if they use a magical device from their diametric magic field, the priest will have 1 drop applied to their roll when using it.

#### Spell aspect action points cost

Casting spells draws from the priest’s action point pool as a representation of willpower and faith needed to execute wondrous acts of divine power. Priests have a base spell action cost of 2. For details on how magic works, please consult the Magic & Spells section. Priests recover action points at the rate of 1 point per combat round.

### Thief

Masters of the night, stealth and shadows, thieves are the only characters that can do things like pick locks, find and disarm traps, pickpocket, and backstab enemies.

Thieves get 1 boost on Physical Defense (PD) due to their learned nimbleness and skill to avoid damage, and can use magical items and weapons. They are limited to one-handed melee weapons but can use any missile weapon, including two-handed devices like longbows. A thief cannot wear armor nor use a shield.

#### Background

A thief character could have one of these suggested backgrounds:

*   Criminal
*   Streetwise
*   Forgery
*   Smuggler

#### Thief skills

These actions are special to the thief, and no other class can perform these successfully, as they have no training on performing them. Utilizing a thief skill takes one full action from a combat round, although the character can move if applicable. Note that you do not need to spend action points to use these special skills when not engaged in battle.

By default, the thief will roll 2d6 when performing these skills, however, as shown below, the player can choose to spend AP to add boosts to their rolls at the cost of 1 AP per boost.

##### Hiding & stealth

A thief character can “hide” in plain sight, even in the middle of combat. It does this through knowledge of the environment, intuitive knowledge of people, distraction techniques, and physical dexterity. However, they cannot hide from an opponent they’re engaged with; they can only do so if they move away from the engaged opponent.

They’re also able to move very silently as to avoid detection. They might get 1 additional boost on these rolls when environmental situations are pertinent, like hiding in a dark room, or being stealthy while walking on a stone floor.

##### Find & remove traps

The thief is the only character skilled in the fine art of finding and removing sophisticated traps like those found protecting a room or a piece of furniture like a chest, although they can also find simpler traps like those set in the wilderness to hunt for animals

##### Pick pockets

They are capable of stealing personal belongings from people without being noticed by the victims. A thief can gain a boost when performing this action in a very crowded situation like in the middle of a busy market, or in the darkness (combined with stealth).

##### Open locks

Thieves are adept at lock picking. The chances of success depends on the sophistication of the lock.

#### Maneuvers

Thieves have access to special maneuvers in combat. Note that the action points are spent regardless of the action being successful or not. A thief character recovers 1 action point per combat round.

Event         | Maneuver                          | Cost
--------------|-----------------------------------|------
Attack        | Hide in combat                    | 3
              | Move silently in combat           | 2
              | Knock opponent unconscious        | 2
              | Attack additional target          | 5
Other         | Add boost to thief special skill  | 1

#### Backstabbing

Thief characters have the skill to backstab enemies. To do so successfully, the thief must first have succeeded on a hide in combat roll. After this, they need to spend 1 AP for every drop they want to add to their target’s Physical Defense. A successful backstab attack always inflicts a life point regardless of the dice roll result.

Once the backstabbing attack occurs, the thief is no longer hidden in combat.

### Warrior

Masters of combat, slayers of beasts, defenders of the weak: warriors are unarguably fearsome in melee and missile combat. Whether they are soldiers, mercenaries, or simply seasoned adventurers, they are the ones who bring the cold steel to the party.

They get 1 boost on Physical Action (PA) due to their intensive training and experience, and also start with 1 additional life point. Warriors are the only class who can use all types of weapons, armor, and shields, including magical versions of these.

However, warriors are unable to use magical devices such as wands, rods, and scrolls.

#### Background

These are suggested backgrounds for a warrior character:

*   Soldier
*   Mercenary
*   Vigilante
*   Hometown Hero


#### Combat maneuvers

Warriors use their action point pool in combat for additional damage or special maneuvers. These maneuvers are used on attack and defense rolls. Note that the action points are spent regardless of the attack or defense being successful or not. The warrior can spend as many points as desired in a combat round, and they recover 1 action point per round.

Event         | Maneuver                                   | Cost
--------------|--------------------------------------------|------
Attack        | Additional attack at same opponent         | 2
              | Attack secondary target                    | 4
              | Drop opponent’s Physical Defense, per drop | 3
              | Disarm opponent (when applicable)          | 2
              | Knock opponent unconscious                 | 4
              | Push opponent out of engaged range         | 3
Defense       | Parry                                      | 2
              | Disarm opponent on parry (when applicable) | 4

##### Additional attack at same opponent

The warrior executes additional attacks to his current opponent.

##### Attack secondary target

The warrior switches to attack a secondary target within range in the same round. Note that the attack must be made with the same type of weapon; the warrior cannot switch between a sword and a longbow, for example.

##### Drop opponent's Physical Defense

The warrior executes feints, fancy footwork, and other deceiving moves to distract their opponent, causing a drop on the target’s Physical Defense score.

##### Disarm opponent

When applicable, the warrior performs a move to cause their opponent to drop their weapon immediately. This maneuver does not inflict damage on the victim.

##### Knock opponent unconscious

On a successful roll, the warrior’s opponent is knocked unconscious but does not receive damage. The victim is under the _unconscious _condition and all the regular rules apply.

##### Push opponent out of engaged range

The warrior can only perform this move with a melee weapon. By applying force to their attack, the warrior can make the opponent move back out of engaged distance (ZZ).

##### Parry

By using defensive maneuvering, controlled parrying and evasive movements, the warrior can increase their physical defense by 1 boost.

##### Disarm opponent on parry

When parrying, the warrior can opt to try and disarm their opponent. On a successful Physical Defense roll, the opponent will be forced to drop their weapon, if applicable.

### Wizard

These are the masters of the arcane arts. Through diligent study and commitment, they have learned to control the divine forces of magic that shape the world and have studied the anatomy and minds of creatures to understand how those powers are channeled through their physical bodies.

They get a boost on Mental Action (MA), but start with 1 less life point due to their dedication to studies leading to a sedentary life. Wizards can only use one-handed weapons, simple missile weapons, and cannot wear any armor or use shields.

#### Background

These are some suggested backgrounds for wizards:

*   Alchemist
*   Arcanist
*   Charlatan
*   Seer

#### Magic fields

A wizard has three magic field mastery levels available when starting as a fresh character. These mastery levels allow a wizard character to choose from one to three magic fields of knowledge. Each point represents a Mastery level in the magical arts.

Spending 1 mastery level on a field makes the wizard an Initiate of that magic field. If the wizard uses 2 levels, that makes them a Veteran of the chosen magic field. Spending all 3 levels on a single magic field turns the wizard into a Master of the chosen magic field.


#### Spell action points base cost

Like priests, wizards do not need to have spell memorized. Base cost is presented per Field Mastery level. Wizards recover 1 AP per combat round regardless of the mastery level.

Mastery Level | Base Cost
--------------|----------
Initiate      | 3
Veteran       | 2
Master        | 1

For details on how magic works, please consult the _Magic & Spells _section.

## CLASS/RACE ACTION ROLLS

To ease basic character creation, here’s a matrix showing the different combat rolls based on class and race. This table also allows direct comparison between the different race and class combinations, allowing you to choose the one closer to what you want in your character.

Class   | Roll | Elf | Dwarf | Halfling | Human
--------|------|-----|-------|----------|------
Priest  | PA   | 1   | 2     | 1        | 1

        | MD   | 1   | 1     | 1        | 2

## Magic & spells

Perilous Ventures uses an action point system to manage magic. Action points, as the name implies, allow your character to perform certain actions by spending them in combat situations.

It is understood that those who have magical powers, whether from arcane or divine sources, have a full understanding of the Art, and it flows from them naturally. Therefore, there’s no need for rest periods to restore magical capabilities, no spell components, or any other devices to be able to perform magical feats.

There is no need for spell casters to memorize or pre-select spells. The system also has a base mechanism that allows the players to create their own spells. You will find a list of spells below that will give you a good idea on what can be done with this flexible system.

When a spell is cast, no other action can be performed, not even moving, as casting a spell takes all the effort and concentration from the spell caster. Only one spell per combat round can be cast.

Magic works as a sudden opening of the divine gates of power intrinsic in all creatures. Sustaining the flow of that magical power for extended periods would kill any creature, no matter how powerful. Due to this, all magic spells have very short duration, relatively speaking, with only the most powerful creatures and a few select individuals being able to cast spells that last more than half a minute.

### Spellcasters relationship with magic

Magic has deep links to the deities that rule over the known universe. They use creatures of the world as a channel to extend their power and domain throughout the planes of existence. Each principal deity is directly linked to a magic field.

#### Priests

Priests are chosen as heralds of a deity, and as such are their direct representatives on the material world, focusing all their magical casting in the single field that their deity represents and controls.

#### Wizards

Wizards study and channel magic by tapping and utilizing the life energy conduits used by deities that allow creatures the use of magic and cast spells. This allows them to dabble in diverse magic fields, and why they have magic field mastery levels available to them, as it is dependent on where they’ve placed their efforts as they study the arcane.

### Magic fields

Spells have certain categories that reflect the source of their particular characteristics. These categories are known as magic fields.

Each magic field has a direct link to a particular deity that is the source for that type of magic. Each field also has an opposite, or diametric, field as a manifestation of the universal balance around which life revolves.

When presenting the spell effects, particularly those that are offensive in nature, the effect being explained occur only when the target fails their Mental Defense action roll.

#### Change

Ambius is the god of transition, change and evolution. His holy symbol is a black and white five-pointed star with angled points, representing movement and change. Ambius’ physical manifestation is that of an elder, male human tinkerer with endless pouches and tools, and six-fingered hands.

The magic that Ambius grants allows the spellcaster to alter the physical properties of a creature, object, or the environment. With Change magic, a spellcaster can haste or slow down a creature or object, modify the physical features of an object, a creature, or themselves. They can also alter the location a creature or object in any direction.

Its diametric magic field is Preservation.

##### Limitations

The alterations performed through Change magic that go against the natural state of things are not permanent; they only last as long as the spell duration takes place. For example, if a spell reduces the size of a creature, it will come back to its normal size after the spell’s effect ends. This magic only is able to change existing properties of their target and not add new ones.

##### Spells

###### Flip

The spell causes the target to flip position as chosen by the spellcaster: upside down, sideways, prone, or facing in the opposite direction.

###### Hold Movement

When successful, this spell prevents the target from moving, whether a creature or an object. In the case of a creature, they will be under the Paralyzed condition, totally aware but unable to move for the duration of the spell.

###### Hold Portal

This spell is usually cast on a door, gate, or other type of portal closure system. When successful, it prevents the portal from being open for the duration of the spell.

###### Increase Speed

This spell increases the movement speed of the spell’s target(s). This includes movement and action speed. For every AP spent on the spell’s effect, movement will be increased by 1 zone, and add 1 boost to every PD roll through the duration of the spell.

###### Open Portal

This spell will force open any type of gate, door, or portcullis. Its effect is immediate upon success and the portal will remain open until it is closed by normal means or by a spell like _hold portal_.

###### Petrify

This spell causes the target, whether a creature or object, to be turned to stone for the duration of the spell. In the case of a living being, they are not dead, but rather in a suspended, limbo-like condition, meaning that they will have no memories of anything that happens while they are in this state. Any damage received in stone form will affect the spell’s target when they return to their normal state.

###### Reduce Size

This spell reduces the size of the target object or creature by half. This has the effect of boosting the PD of the target by 1 per every AP spent due to the smaller size, but will also simultaneously add 1 drop to the target’s PA. The spell can also focus a part of the target and not the whole entity.

###### Teleport

The spell instantly changes the location of the spellcaster or a creature or object to a base distance of 1 zone. Additional distance is determined by the amount of effect AP spent in the spell, at the rate of 1 additional zone per AP.

###### Tunnel

This spell enables the caster to open a temporary tunnel through any material. The depth of the tunnel is 1 zone by default, with extra zones of depth applied for every AP spent in its effect.

#### Death

Muer is the goddess of death and despair. Her symbol is an orange and black circle of fire, and her physical manifestation is that of a frail female orc whose head is an empty hole. Her magic negates the life force of creatures & plants, and it is also used to create and control undead. The diametric field for Death is Life.

Using this type of magic, a spellcaster can animate and control corpses as undead, speak with the dead, poison creatures, and cause putrefaction and sickness.

##### Limitations

The spellcaster wielding this magic cannot cause permanent direct death on a victim; they can only cause damage and effects that might kill an opponent.

##### Spells

###### Banish Soul

For the duration of the spell, the target’s soul is sent to the domain of Muer. Their body will fall to the ground lifeless; in fact, for all purposes, the creature is dead until the soul returns back to their body. Due to the traumatic effect of the soul leaving the body, on a roll of 6 the victim will take one point of damage when returning.

###### Control Undead

This spell allows the caster to control undead beings that are within the casting area at the time it is cast. If successful, they will follow all the commands given by the spellcaster for the duration of the spell. Control over undead creatures lasts only as long as the spell is in effect; once the spell ends, the undead creature will keep moving about on its own will.

###### Imbue Fear

By casting this spell, the caster awakens the fear of death in any creature, which is under the afraid condition for the duration of the spell.

###### Inflict Sickness

This spell inflicts an ailment chosen by the spellcaster against their victim(s). Upon success, the victim will be under the incapacitated condition for the duration of the spell.

###### Raise Undead

This spell allows the caster to raise one or more dead creatures as undead. The type of undead depends on the condition of the corpse. Skeletons will raise and function as such, while corpses that have some or all or their flesh (regardless of the state) will be raised as zombies. Raising the undead creatures do not automatically grant control of them.

###### Speak with Dead

By casting the spell, the caster can talk to any dead creature that might understand spoken language. They can converse with the corpse for the duration of the spell.

###### Spoil Sustenance

When cast on an edible item, it will become poisoned. A creature that eats or drinks the product by failing their MD roll will be under the poisoned condition.

###### System Shock

When this spell is cast on a creature, it causes a brief pause to the victim’s life support mechanisms; heart, lungs, and brain are stopped for a split second. On a successful spell, the victim will be under the Incapacitated condition for the duration of the spell.

#### Deceit

Lies, trickery, illusions, and falsehood… Ruco is the master of them all. Their holy symbol is a white, black and teal open hand facing forward, upside down, with a simple smile in its palm. Their physical depiction is that of a genderless, small, cloaked humanoid with four arms, and a face forever hidden.

Ruco’s magic temporarily tricks the minds and senses of others. It can also affect the minds of other creatures to attempt control. Also, spells that produce illusions are included in this field.

The diametric of Deceit magic is Truth.

##### Limitations

None of the effects performed with Deceit magic are permanent. Trying to imbue a completely unnatural thought into a creature, such as killing themselves or a close relative, will have no effect on the target.

##### Spells

###### Appear Invisible

When this spell is cast on a creature, it will make whatever is chosen by the caster to appear invisible, including themselves. This does not mean that the object or creature chosen is invisible, but rather that the target(s) of the spell cannot see the object being hidden by the spell.

###### Deafness

When cast upon a creature, it will cause the target to not be able to hear any sounds for the duration of the spell.

###### Disguise

For the duration of the spell, the caster can make themself or another creature look totally different, based on the imagination and images in the mind of the caster.

###### Fool Senses

For the duration of the spell, the caster can change any one of the target’s senses to perceive something different than reality; a foul smell, darkness, a bitter taste in the mouth, a bitter cold.

###### Friend

The target of the spell will think that the spellcaster is their friend. Therefore, they will not attack the caster, and will listen to them. However, this doesn’t mean the target of the spell is under mind control; they merely see the caster as a friend for the duration of the spell.


###### Illusion

The spellcaster can create a complete illusion with visual, auditory, and olfactory aspects. The size and duration of this illusion is dependent on the amount of action AP spent in it.

###### Invisibility

The spellcaster makes themself or another object or creature invisible for the duration of the spell. Not that, unlike _Appear Invisible_, where it affects a select group of targets  in this case the target of the spell is actually invisible.

###### Nightmares

This spell allows the caster to cause one or more creatures to see their worst fears and nightmares in their minds. Under these circumstances, the victims will be under the panic condition, unable to act coherently and will try to run away to escape the visions in their head.

###### Produce Sounds

The spellcaster produces a sound, any sound, to come from themselves or from another area. The sound can also be made to last a certain amount of time, at the rate of 1 effect AP per every 5 seconds.

###### Silent Sphere

This spell creates an invisible sphere that suppresses all kinds of sounds in their totality, even from magical sources.

###### Ventriloquism

The spellcaster can make his voice appear to sound from another part of the area for the duration of the spell.

#### Element

Some say Erra created the physical parts of the world as it is known, and still manipulates creation to this day. Her symbol is a short totem of light blue wind, brown earth, and red fire. Erra’s physical depiction is of a tree that looks like a living, naked, elven female with leaves of fire and wearing boots of stone.

With this magic field, the spellcaster can channel and manipulate the elements and energies of the universe to cause a certain effect, like producing fire, electricity, control water, or create a magnetic field. The diametric of Element is Ethereal magic.

##### Limitations

Being able to control these elements does not grant invulnerability to them; for example, the spellcaster can be burned as easily as anyone else by their own fire if they’re not careful.

##### Spells

###### Earthen Wall

With this spell, the caster raises a rock and dirt solid wall from the ground to use as a barrier against attacks, or to deter the advance of enemies.

###### Fireball

A huge fire explosion covers a sphere defined by the spellcaster, causing damage to all targets within it on a failed MD roll. If the attack roll is a 6, the targets will be on fire until it is put out. If the fireball lasts for more than one round, the targets that have failed their defense roll and still within its coverage area will receive an additional point of damage per round.

###### Firestream

The spellcaster shoots a stream of fire from their hands, striking a target. The victim receives damage from this attack, plus if applicable, will be also set on fire until it is put out.

###### Gale Push

###### Lightning Strike

On a successful attack, the target of this spell is hit with a lightning bolt that comes from the caster’s hands, receiving immediate damage. On a roll of 6 the target will catch fire due to the high temperature of the electric bolt.

###### Magnetic Vortex

A central point chosen by the spellcaster becomes a highly-powered magnetic field that attracts anything that is made of a ferromagnetic material like steel and iron. Someone wearing metal armor will be under the paralysis condition, and will not be able to move away from this vortex or attack for the duration of the spell.

###### Tidal Wave

A forceful wave of water generates from the caster’s hands and slams on a chosen target, causing immediate damage.

#### Ethereal

Mosferi is the god of the spiritual and ethereal. His symbol is a swirling ten-spoke star of white and silver, and his physical depiction is that of a floating, ghost-like humanoid shape with floating hands.

His magic, when granted to material creatures, allows them to control the invisible spiritual forces that manipulate the universe, including the lost souls that wander the material plane. The diametric magic for this field is Element.

Wielders of this magic can have powers such as telekinesis, being able to invoke and control spirits (which can do things for them, including fighting and defending), and form ghostly force fields and barriers.

##### Limitations

The influence over any spiritual creatures invoked through this magic will go away as soon as the spell’s effect ends.

##### Spells

###### Empyreal Blade

A wonderful weapon made of sheer ethereal forces appears in the hands of the spellcaster or a target for the duration of the spell. This weapon cannot be lost or dropped unless the spellcaster recalls it. The caster can choose what kind of weapon it will be (one-handed or two-handed), and the usage and damage will be as established by the weapon type.

###### Escaping Soul

The spellcaster can cause themselves or a target creature to have the soul escape their body for the duration of the spell. In this amount of time, their body will fall to the ground lifeless, and the soul will be able to roam about, allowing them to go through walls and wander around the area harmlessly.

###### Ethereal Grasp

The spellcaster invokes forces from the spiritual plane to grasp and prevent a creature or object from moving for the duration of the spell.

###### Floating Platform

This spell creates a shimmering platform of ethereal power that serves as a platform for carrying objects or people. The amount of weight it can support is basically unlimited, but items placed on the platform must be balanced or they will fall down just like if they were placed on a regular flat surface.

###### Levitate

This allows the caster, a creature, or an object to float above the ground as they are being held by invisible spiritual entities. This spell can also be used to avoid hitting the ground in the case of a fall from a great height, thus not receiving any damage.

###### Spirit Helper

When cast, this spell will cause a ghostly being to appear and help the spellcaster in anything they request, for the duration of the spell. They can invoke more helpers are the rate of 1 AP per helper. For combat purposes, these spiritual creatures are considered as ghosts.

On its most basic form the spell provides 1 boost to the PD and MD rolls of the target for the duration of the spell. More protection can be applied at the rate of 1 boost per action AP spent.

###### Telekinesis

Through ethereal forces, the spellcaster can move objects for the duration of the spell.

#### Life

The goddess Vid is the bringer of life to the universe. She is depicted as a graceful yet faceless human man with long, flowing blue hair and the body of a glowing star, and her holy symbol, similarly, is that of a blue and white star with 10 long, thin points.

A wielder of Life magic can heal damage and sickness, provide resistance against damage, provide sustenance, and create magical shields and barriers to protect life.

Its diametric magic is Death.

##### Limitations

Life magic can heal and bring back an entity from the brink of death, but cannot resuscitate a creature; once a living being dies, it is final.

##### Spells

###### Destroy Undead

Through this spell, the caster can destroy one or more undead creatures instantly on a successful attack. The undead creature will drop to the ground and will disintegrate quickly, leaving behind anything that it might have been wearing or carrying.

#### Preservation

Aja is the goddess of preservation and protection. Her holy symbol is a gold and green shield, and her physical depiction is of a fully armored dwarven woman wielding two large spiked shields.

The diametric magic of Preservation is Change.

##### Limitations

Any shields created by this magic only last for the duration of the spell.

##### Spells

###### Banish Entity

This spell causes any entity that does not belong to the material plane to be sent back to their place of origin.

###### Ensnare

For the duration of the spell, or until it’s triggered, the caster places an invisible trap in an area. If an entity crosses that area and fails their MD roll, they will be ensnared and trapped for the remaining duration of the spell, under the incapacitated condition.

His holy symbol is a silver eye with a blue iris, and he’s depicted as a crotchety, bent, old human man with long gray hair and bushy eyebrows, who always carries a silver magnifying glass with him.

The spells from this magic field reveal information like glimpses of the future, finding hidden objects, or see through the veil of falsehood. Deceit is the diametric of this magic field.

##### Limitations

Divinations are not necessarily accurate, as the future is relatively unpredictable, shifting and changing as events occur in the present.

##### Spells

###### Detect Magic

By casting this spell, the caster can see and detect magical sources like magical devices, magic-imbued buildings and items, and those who are able to manipulate magic.

###### Find Object

This spell allows the caster to find any object they might know about wither by having seen it, or by description. The spellcaster must have a clear image of the subject, or have been in contact with it. If the spellcaster only knows the object by description, they will have 1 drop applied to their MA roll.

###### Ignore Illusion

This spell allows the caster or a recipient to see through any magical illusions that might have been placed upon an object or an entity.

###### Know Object

When casting this spell upon an object, it reveals all the objects characteristics and features to the spellcaster. A sentient or magical object will not automatically reveal its origins, meaning the GM needs to roll 1d6 as MD against the spell when cast on these types of devices. If the spell fails, it can be cast again, but every time it is retried, the object’s MD is boosted by 1.

###### Obvious Target

When cast upon an object or entity, it causes them to attract attacks onto them by revealing their possible future movements to anyone within sight. For the duration of the spell, the target gets 1 drop added to all their PD rolls. Additional drops can be added to the effect at the rate of 1 drop per AP spent.

###### Understand Languages

This spell allows the caster to understand any language, heard or written, for the duration of the spell.

###### Visionary Strike

When this spell is cast on someone fighting with weapons, it provides a momentary glimpse of the target’s movements in the future, allowing for an increased chance to hit the target. This spell adds 1 boost to the target’s PA roll. Additional boosts can be added at the rate of 1 boost for 1 AP spent.

###### Word of Auspice

The spellcaster gets a blurry vision of the future. The end result of that vision is summarized in a single word that burns in the caster’s mind. The GM has full freedom on determining what that word is.

The divination powers offered by this spell are not completely accurate, as the future fluctuates and changes; therefore the farther in to the future that the spellcaster views, the more blurry and uncertain it will be.

### Building a spell

To build a spell and figure out the total action point cost required to cast it, you start off from the base action point cost for the character class. Details of those costs are presented in each class description, and in the summary table at the end of this section.

#### Using verb & noun combinations

Something that might help in building spells is to think of them in terms of basic verb & noun combinations. With this system, you have an action or effect, and the recipient of that verb. Here are some simple examples.

Magic Field  | Verb       | Nun       | Effect
-------------|------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------
Change       | Increase   | Speed     | Makes a creature or moving object faster.
Death        | Raise      | Dead      | Raise a creature as an undead entity.
Deceit       | Appear     | Invisible | Make themselves appear invisible to the spell's targets.
Element      | Shoot      | Fire      | Flames spring from the caster's hands against a target.
Life         | Heal       | Wounds    | Heals damage to a creature.
Preservation | Raise      | Shield    | An invisible protection shield is raised around a target.
Truth        | Find       | Object    | Find an object of which the spellcaster knows about.

#### Spell aspects

Spells are defined by elements known as aspects. Each of these aspects represents the basic characteristics of a spell.

##### Area

This defines the space that the spell’s effect will cover. There are two types of spell areas.

###### Single target

This spell’s affects a single creature or object. A single target spell does not cost any additional AP.

###### Zone

The spell’s area of effect, shaped like a sphere and centered at the point selected by the spell caster, taking up height, depth, and width. As the name implies, the size of this sphere of effect is measured in zones, with one zone being around 25 feet. Adding zones costs +1 AP per zone.

##### Range

This determines how far away from the caster the spell will take effect. Range is also measured in zones. Spells cast at a distance of 1 zone or less have no additional cost. Any distance beyond 1 zone has a cost of +1 AP per zone.

##### Duration

A spell usually has an instantaneous effect. If the spellcaster desires to have the spell last for a longer time period, they must spend +1 AP for each additional combat round that the spell will be active.

##### Action

For all the actions listed below, if the spellcaster’s top roll is a 6, there might be an additional effect for the spell.

###### Damage

All spells cast for damage will deduct a hero point to their target on a successful attack, or a life point if the top die Mental Action attack result is a 6 and is greater than the target’s Mental Defense roll.

###### Effect

Instead of damage, a spell can have a special effect, such as poisoning, an illusion, causing the target to sleep, or setting an object on fire. The effect of the spell is based on the magic field that the spell belongs to.

###### Altering game mechanic elements

All effects that increase or decrease a defined gaming element, for example: movement zones, dice roll boosts, or additional actions in a combat round, will only affect said element by a count of 1 in its base cost. For example, if a spell increases the speed of a target, it will only increase that speed by 1 zone. Any additional increases (or penalties) have a cost of 1 AP per unit.

#### Summary

This table summarizes the action point costs for building and modifying spells.

Spell Aspect | Description                  | AP Cost
-------------|------------------------------|--------
Base Cost    | Priest                       | 2
             | Wizard, Initiate             | 3
             | Wizard, Veteran              | 2
             | Wizard, Master               | 1
Area         | Single target                | 0
             | Zone sphere, per zone        | 1
Range        | Touch/melee (<= 5')          | 0
             | 1+ zones, per zone           | 1
Duration     | Instantaneous/1 combat round | 0
             | 2+ combat rounds, per round  | 1
Action       | Damage (always 1 point)      | 0
             | Effect, base effect unit     | 0
             | Effect, per additional unit  | 1

_NOTE: For action effect AP, units refer to zones, size, or any other type of game mechanic elements increase or decrease._

## Backgrounds

A character’s background selection is important, as they determine the character’s ability to excel in certain skill areas, and also help define the character as a unique person in the world. Backgrounds also can provide backstory ideas for your character that can be brought into the game at some point.

These areas can be broad and allow the character to have specialized skills that allow them to perform actions they would not be normally able to do. A background grants you advantages when performing skills related to it. For example, knowing how to fix metal if you have an Armorer background.

A character who tries to perform an action tied to their background will have a base roll of 2d6 and comparing the top die roll result against a set skill difficulty score between 1 and 5. If the skill roll is higher than the difficulty score set, the action is successful.

The number of dice that need to be rolled for a skill check can be affected by boosts and drops through environmental situations, conditions, or magical effects.

### Choosing your backgrounds

Characters start off with any three backgrounds available. For races other than humans, a suggestion of fitting backgrounds is presented. However, you can still choose any other backgrounds that you prefer for your character.

Below the Combat Rolls section, write down “Backgrounds” as the title of a new section in your sheet, as we’re going to start filling in that information too. As you read the race descriptions and choose one, make sure to write down the backgrounds chosen for your character if you choose to do so at the moment. You can always leave background selection for the end of the process, when you have an idea on who you want your character to be.

### Character backgrounds

Here are some examples of background that are available for player characters. However, these are just examples, and players, together with their game master, can come up with additional backgrounds that fit the story or the desired history of the player character.

Remember that backgrounds must be kept relatively well-focused, and not made far too encompassing, as it dilutes their purpose.

#### Hometown Hero

A character with this background is well-educated in secular and religious history. They will have a very good chance of figuring out historical and religious influences, and will remember events and information that is important in the history of the world.

#### Smuggler

The character knows the best way to infiltrate merchandise into a city, the correct way to handle things, and also knows the people and distributors of whatever objects or materials are illegal in their location, or that have  a large black market due to the item’s high cost.

#### Soldier

Characters with the soldier background have served in a militia for a long-enough period of time to get them fully acquainted with the inner workings of an army, have a decent grasp of strategy, and have a good chance of knowing someone in a high military rank.

#### Stonemason

A character with this background is deft at working with stone in all its uses including construction and decoration. The character will be able to determine the type of rock or mineral, origin, and source of the construction in the case of a building or structure. In some cases they will be able to recognize weak points of the structure.

#### Streetwise

City streets are the character’s natural environment; they know the people, the happenings, the incoming events (and we’re not talking about the local carnival). It is easy for the character to find information about what is going on, and about who’s who.

#### Survivalist

The character lived for a long time by yourself, alone in the wilderness (this can be a forest, desert, or any other biome). As such, they learned how to survive and thrive in that kind of environment. This includes hunting, trap-making, foraging, and the use of hunting bows.

#### Traveler

Characters with the traveler background will be adept at finding and using ground transportation suitable for a journey. They are experts at reading maps and possess an above-average sense of direction. A character with this background will hardly get lost even in complicated travel situations.

#### Vigilante

The character roams the streets illegally looking for those who commit crimes, and deal justice on their own terms. They might or might not be known to exist by the local authorities, but they’ve learned to keep a low profile and how to move unnoticed through the dark streets.

## Weapons & gear

It is time to equip your character with gear and weapons, to get them ready for adventuring. There are two options available for acquiring your initial gear, and this is something that you need to arrange with the Game Master.

### Money

The base coin for this system is the gold piece (GP). However, there are other coins available in the market.

Coin              | Unit per GP
------------------|------------
Gold piece (GP)   | 1
Silver Piece (SP) | 10
Copper Piece (CP) | 100

Your character’s initial amount of money is equal to 3d6 x 10 GP. Therefore, if you roll a total of 13, your character will have 130 GP total.

An alternative way for determining the starting money amount is to roll 4d6, and then just take the higher three dice rolls, add those up, and multiply by 10. For example, if you rolled 5, 6, 2, and 4, you will pick 5 + 6 + 4 = 15, which multiplied by 10 equal 150 GP.

With this amount of money, your character is ready to buy the weapons and equipment needed for a successful adventure. For cost estimation purposes, a good rule of thumb is that one GP equals $100 USD.

#### Free starting gear

An option when starting up is to let the players get whatever equipment the character needs, free. This can be a way to hasten things in terms of game preparation, or if the adventure will be a tough one and both the GM and the players want to make sure they are not lacking in terms of gear and weapons. If this were the method chosen, instead of rolling 3d6 for the initial GP amount, players would roll 4d6 and add up the total, without multiplying by 10.

### Weapons

There are two types of melee weapons available: one-handed and two-handed. A one-handed weapon adds 1 boost to the Physical Action roll, and a two-handed weapon adds 2 boosts to Physical Action rolls. Being that there are only two weapon types available, weapon choice within each type becomes more of a way to give color and style to a character.

The equipment list shows which weapons are single-handed, and which are two-handed. A few weapons can be both one-handed and two-handed, and the player can choose in which “mode” to use the weapon. However, to use a weapon as two-handed, the character cannot be wearing a shield.

Also, all bows and crossbows are considered to be two-handed.

### Armor

Some character classes can wear armor to protect themselves from damage. Wearing armor gives the wearer 1 boost on Physical Defense.

#### Shields

Using a shield gives you 1 boost to your Physical Defense and your Mental Defense. Not all classes can use a shield, and it can only be worn if the weapon used is a one-handed unit.

### Adventuring gear

Using the appropriate adventuring gear will be the only way to perform certain actions, or provide a boost when doing them while adventuring. Make sure your character is well equipped. Gear will allow you to perform certain actions without penalty. For example, having rope for climbing a wall, or having a tinderbox to set a fire.

## FINALIZING THE DETAILS

By now, your character should be well-defined in terms of numbers and stats, but the question is: Who is your character? Of all the tasks related to creating a player character in an RPG system, this is the most difficult task for most people. However, if you find yourself in this situation, don’t despair.


### Defining who your character is


#### Spontaneous growth

It is perfectly good to not have an idea of who your character is, their personality and traits, and yet have a very enjoyable game session. It turns out that most of the time, as you play your character, you will inevitably develop certain characteristics as you play. Also, some of the actions performed during gameplay spark ideas and concepts that will allow you to define who your character is.

Sometimes, players who have a clear idea of who their character is before starting off the very first game session see their character change and grow, and sometimes becoming something quite different from their original idea. This is good, as this means the player is really involved in the game and using game events and game relationships to provide depth to the character.


#### The importance of a name

Your character’s name is very important, as it also helps set the mood. You can have a fantasy name like Lorenell Willowbrook, or Fintas the Horrible. It can also be something as simple as Jan or Kylie. What matters is that the name chosen is not one that you will regret having later on as your character grows and it becomes part of the adventuring world.


## RUNNING THE GAME

You have decided to be the Game Master and lead your friends into a world of adventure and excitement. Fantastic! To do this, you need to understand how to run combat, manage monsters, and keep track of all the happenings in every session. It might sound daunting, but Perilous Ventures is designed to be easy to run.


### The ORC Engine

This game uses the Opposed Roll Contest engine (ORC) to determine combat & magic action results.

In its most basic form, there are two rolls related to an action, thus called an Action Roll. For example, in combat there is an attacker and a defender. Both sides roll the required amount of dice based on any modifiers. But the dice are not added up, instead, only the top die from each roll is picked. If the attacker’s highest die is higher than the defender’s highest die, the attack is successful and inflicts damage. If the defender wins, they avoid receiving damage.

As an example: Rolfar the dwarf warrior swings at a hobgoblin with his axe. As a dwarf with a one-handed weapon, he gets to roll 4d6 for his attack action, while the hobgoblin rolls 2d6 for defense. Rolfar’s player rolls 5, 2, 2, and 1, while the GM rolls 4 and 3 for the hobgoblin’s defense. The player’s top roll was a 5, while the GM’s top roll was a 4, therefore Rolfar hits the hobgoblin for damage.

The only die used in this system is the 6-sided die (d6), the reason for this being accessibility; You can find six-sided dice everywhere, and can be acquired cheaply or taken from most common board games.


#### Action rolls (AR)

Characters and creatures do not have ability stats as in other RPGs. Capabilities are determined by action rolls. These action rolls will always consist of a set of opposed actions, except for skill checks. Action rolls cover a wide gamut of skills that are “blended” together for a final purpose.


##### MELEE & MISSILE WEAPON COMBAT


###### Physical Action (PA)

Covers all the skills involved in melee and missile combat: using a weapon properly, knowing its strengths and weaknesses, and how to use it most effectively.

Physical Action is used when a character or creature attempts to strike an opponent with a physical weapon, either melee or missile, or performs an unarmed attack. This also includes creature attacks made with claws, biting, or similar types of strikes.


###### Physical Defense (PD)

This action covers defensive battle knowledge such as parrying, knowing the limits and capabilities of weapons and using that to avoid damage, and strategic movement in combat to better defend themselves.

The target of a Physical Action performs this dice roll to compete against the attack roll and avoid receiving damage.


##### SPELLS & MAGICAL DEVICES


###### Mental Action (MA)

This action roll covers knowledge of the arcane and the mystical. It also delves into an entity’s ability to manage and handle magical powers, either by nature or by training. This combination of factors makes someone being able to handle magical powers either through magic spells or by using a magical device.

This is the roll used by spellcasters to determine their success when utilizing spells. Any player characters using magical devices such as staves or wands also performs this dice roll.


###### Mental Defense (MD)

This is a mix of natural resilience and resistance to magic, and also knowledge on how to diminish or entirely avoid spells and their effects. This is the dice roll made by the target of a Magic Action attack to avoid receiving damage or any other spell effects. Note that if the target of a spell is a willing recipient of such magic, this roll is not needed.


##### SKILL CHECKS

A character might try to perform a non-combat action like performing a song, making a high jump, or deduct the meaning of an arcane writing. These skill check rolls have diverse levels of difficulty, and the character’s ability to be successful in these checks is determined by the character’s background.

Unlike combat rolls, non-combat skill checks are performed against a static number from 1 to 5, called a difficulty score (DS). These numbers represent difficulty levels, and the higher the target number, the more difficult the task is.

  </tr>
</table>


A character with a background will roll 2d6, pick the top die result and compare against the difficulty number.  To succeed at the task, the player must have a top die result higher than the difficulty level set for the task.

If a player fails at a skill check roll, successive skill checks for the same character will be performed at +1 drop per retry. See below for an explanation of the boosts and drops mechanism.


###### Non-background checks

If a character has no relevant background to perform the task, the GM needs to briefly analyze what the player intends to do and judge accordingly. There might be actions that the GM decrees that it would be impossible for the character to try to perform the action, for example, forging a knife without the _Armorer _background.

On other occasions, there might be a chance for the character to perform the task; for example, trying to emulate a signature without the _Embezzler _background. In such a situation, the GM can determine that the skill check will be made with a straight 1d6 roll, or even add one or more drops if the task is considered to be quite difficult, specific, or obscure in nature.


#### Boosts & drops

Modifications to action rolls and skill checks are needed for different reasons: race & class modifiers, magical effects, or special situations. Modifying a dice roll is done with the boosts and drops mechanism. These change the rolls being performed, altering the chances of an action being successful.


##### BOOST

For most of the game, action rolls are performed with boosts; you can see it as the system’s default operating mode for its action mechanics and resolution.

One boost equals an additional d6 to include in the dice roll. But boosts are not added to your roll sum total. If you have 1 boost for a roll, you will roll 2d6 (basic d6 roll + 1 boost die), but as explained above, your final result is determined by the highest die result. For example, if you rolled 4  and 1, you only keep the 4 as your final result.

This process is exactly the same regardless of how many boosts you have; you always keep only the highest die roll. The more boosts you have, the greater the chances of rolling a higher number as the top die roll.


##### DROP

These are the opposite of boosts. For example, if you have 1 drop that applies to your action, you would roll 2d6, then choose the lower die roll. Using the same rolls from the example for boosts above, you would pick 1 as your final roll result.


#### Simultaneous boosts and drops

In the rare case that you have simultaneous boosts and drops for an action roll, find the difference between boosts and drops. If there are more boosts than drops, then the roll will be boosted by that difference. If there are more drops than rolls, the roll will be dropped by said difference.

For example, if you have a roll with 2 boosts (which would normally be 3d6, and sum up the three highest) and 1 drop, the formula would be:

**d6 + 2 boosts = 3d6 - 1 drop = 2d6 boosted**

If you have more drops than boosts, the formula is changed as so:

**d6 + 2 drops = 3d6 - 1 boost = 2d6 dropped**

If the number of boosts equals the number of drops for a roll, then none is applied and the player rolls a single d6.




## COMBAT

Combat resolution follows these steps:



1. Roll initiative for each group to find out the acting order.
2. Declare combat events (move, attack, skill, etc.) per every unit in combat.
3. Perform any action rolls or skill rolls as needed.
4. Immediately record results of the actions.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until everyone has acted.


### Initiative

Initiative for combatants is determined by group. This is a fundamental change from how initiative is used in most systems, especially for player characters.

Instead of rolling per player character, there is only one roll that represents the complete character group. This simplifies the process, and allows players to have full control of strategy, as they can choose and change the fighting order per round. This eliminates having to keep track of things like holding a player’s action waiting for a trigger from another player.

Initiative is rolled only once at the beginning of the encounter, before actual combat actions take place.


#### How to roll for initiative

Each player rolls a d6, with the highest value rolled counting as the initiative roll for the whole player group. The GM rolls for each opponent group. Whichever group rolled the highest goes first, second highest next, and so on.

If the same number is rolled by two groups, the one with the highest member count will go first. In the case of players vs. monsters, if the member count is the same, players go first. In the case of monster groups controlled by the GM, they can arbitrarily decide which group goes first.

After that, the players decide their own combat order in the round. This order can be changed throughout battle, providing interesting strategic options and flexibility for the players.

For boss monsters, or maybe even for an exceptionally strong and dangerous leader of a group of monsters, it is recommended that they have their own individual initiative roll, as it makes for a more thrilling game. This also enhances the sense of danger for the players, by being treating that monster or entity as a separate unit.


#### Surprise

Normally, if the highest initiative roll for a group is equal to 1, that is considered surprised, and thus caught flat-footed and cannot act for one round of combat. This is optional, and it is left to the discretion of the GM based on the situation. Here are a few examples:



*   If the characters make noise entering a dungeon room, whatever monsters are inside will know about the character’s presence, and will not be surprised. However, the characters could be surprised in this situation, for example, if they did not listen for noises or simply expect the room to be empty. \

*   If there is an ambush from either side, then it is obvious that the side being ambushed has to roll for surprise, unless of course, they already are expecting said ambush. \


Use common sense with these situations as a GM, trust your instincts, and go for what would be more enjoyable at that moment in the game.


### Combat round

With initiative set, actual combat can begin. Combat events and actions are sliced into rounds. A round is roughly equal to around 5 seconds of real time. Within each round, there is a sequence of events that happen when the players encounter an enemy and combat ensues.


### Events

Every combat round has a series of events that take place to determine the results of the encounter. In its most basic form, these events are composed of moving and attacking a target. The player in their given round can carry out these events in any order.


#### Move

Characters and creatures can move away to hide, take cover, engage an enemy, or any other reason that might be appropriate. They can also choose not to move and remain in the same position. They might choose to move first and perform an action later, or the opposite. There are limitations to moving, as explained below.


##### ZONES AND DISTANCE

For combat purposes, distance is measured in zones. Each zone starts from zero (see _Engaged_, below), and from that point out, each zone equals 25 feet in any direction. A creature or player character can usually move only a distance of one zone per round of combat. There might be exceptions to this such as an extremely quick creature, or a magical device or spell that enhances speed.

You can call out zones by their level, starting from ZZ (zone zero) as two units being adjacent to each other, and go from there (Z1 up to 25 feet, Z2 up to 50 feet, and so on).

However, some of the zones have defined names to make it easier for players and the GM to determine actions that can be taken by all units involved. These are almost like mental shorthand for these distances, and they are provided because they are the distances used the most when in a combat scenario. However, you can definitely have situations and effects that go beyond the zones described below.


###### Engaged (ZZ)

When two units are involved in melee combat against each other, they are adjacent to each other (at or less than 5 feet away). Of course, you do not have to be fighting a creature to be at that distance, but in terms of combat, it is an easy way to convey the meaning.


###### Nearby (Z1)

This represents units that are at 10 to 25 feet from each other.


###### Far (Z2)

Being 30 to 50 feet away from the target places you at Far distance.


###### Distant (Z3)

Being between 55 to 75 feet from your target places you as Distant to the target. This is the limit of most small missile weapons to fire without penalties.


###### Away (Z4)

This describes a distance of more than 80 feet.


#### Actions


##### BACKGROUND SKILL ACTION

It can be that one of the character’s skills will be useful in the combat round. Performing a skill action will take up the character action event.


##### CAST A SPELL OR USE MAGIC DEVICE

A player or creature can choose instead to use their turn to cast a spell or use a magical device like a scroll or staff. If the spell being cast is an attack or something else for which the spell’s target is not a voluntary target, the caster rolls the dice determined by their Mental Action, and the target rolls their Mental Defense dice. Damage (and its results including any other spell effects) are applied immediately after a successful attack.

As with physical attacks, damage inflicted is counted as hero points, unless the target of the attack has run out of hero points, in which case it will be counted as a life point. If the attacker rolls a 6 for their top die, the attack will directly inflict a life point for damage.

In the case of a spell that doesn’t affect a creature or object in particular, the caster must roll their Mental Action against a difficulty level from 1 to 5. This difficulty level is set by the GM and is based on the character’s current situation.

Due to the unstable and unreliable way magic works, the player must roll for success even for something as simple as illuminating an area with magical light.


##### COMBAT MANEUVER

A warrior or thief might choose to use one of the available combat maneuvers. This takes one full action.


##### DEFEND

A player or creature might choose to defend. When doing this, the entity cannot attack or cast spells, as its busy defending and trying not to be hit. However, they get 1 additional boost on all its physical and mental defense rolls. The defend action lasts for the whole combat round, and must be declared before the whole round begins (as opposed to declaring it on their turn).


##### PHYSICAL ATTACK

To perform a melee or missile strike against an opponent, the attacker needs to roll their Physical Action dice, and the defender rolls their Physical Defense dice. If the attacker’s top die roll is greater than the defender’s top die, the attack is successful and damage is immediately applied.

Damage inflicted is counted as hero points, unless the target of the attack has run out of hero points, in which case it will become life point damage. If the attacker rolls a 6 for their top die, the attack will directly inflict a life point for damage regardless of the existing hero point count.


##### THIEF SKILLS

A player running a thief character might need to use one of their skills in the middle of combat. This will take up all the character’s action, so it will not be able to attack, use a device, etc.


### Damage

Any successful single attack or condition that might harm an entity will deal only 1 point of damage per combat round, regardless of the situation, the weapon used (or no weapon!), spell being cast, condition being suffered, or the type of creature being attacked. This system assumes that any attack is an all-out effort to hurt the target, unless stated otherwise.

There are three types of damage a character can receive: Hero Points (HP), Life Points (LP), and Death Points (DP).


#### Hero Points (HP)

Hero points account for a mixture of resistance to combat fatigue and your character’s willfulness to push forward in combat in spite of being hurt. As your character exerts themselves in combat, your stamina and ability to withstand minor hits diminishes, and this is reflected through a diminishing hero point count.

Losing a hero point might not necessarily mean being stabbed by a sword. Some examples are:



*   Having a sword blade hitting the character’s armor and deflecting the hit, with the resulting impact weakening the character.
*   The result of making a huge effort in avoiding being hit, with the subsequent fatigue and tiredness affecting the character’s performance.

Hero points are inflicted in a successful attack when the top die of the attack is less than 6.


#### Life Points (LP)

Life points are counted off in two situations: when the target runs out of hero points or when it has a direct lethal hit. A direct lethal hit occurs when the top die roll for the attack is a 6.

A monster or creature dies immediately after reaching zero or less life points.

In the case of player characters, when they run out of Life Points, they are unconscious and dying. In the case of a creature, it is automatically dead. However, for special monsters and NPCs, you might wish to enable the death points mechanism explained below.


#### Death Points (DP)

Death points are used when the character is unconscious and dying after receiving enough damage to run out of life points. Characters will always have an initial amount of death points equal to their initial life points.

However, when a character, special NPC, or special monster reaches zero life points, they are not immediately dead. The victim immediately fall unconscious, with all the disadvantages that brings (see _Conditions_), and the death process begins.


##### COUNTDOWN PROCESS IN COMBAT

On each combat round after the victim loses all its life points, either the player or the GM must roll 1d6. If the roll is less than 3, the character loses 1 death point on that round. If the roll is equal or higher than 3, the character is stabilized, and is not dying anymore.

However, if the victim receives any additional hits after being stabilized, each will count as a death point, and the death countdown starts again on the next round after receiving the damage. If the victim at any point runs out of death points, they are officially dead.


##### COUNTDOWN PROCESS OUT OF COMBAT

The process is the same for non-combat time, but it’s accelerated. If a character is dying, the player will need to roll d6 a number up times up to the character’s death points. Besides that, the mechanism works exactly the same way that death points work under combat situations, with the difference that there’s no need to wait for actions from other players and creatures between rolls.


##### INSTANT DEATH

A character is immediately killed if it received more than their death points in damage during combat.


#### Counting down damage

Damage is always counted down in the following order: hero points, then life points when the hero point count reach zero, and finally death points. This applies always except when a character or creature receives a lethal hit, in which case they lose a life point.


#### Lethal damage

Weapons, spells, and creature attacks have a chance to be lethal, inflicting direct life point damage whenever the attacker’s top die roll is a 6. Also, once a character or creature runs out of hero points, all damage taken afterwards is life point damage, regardless of the top die roll results.


#### Falling

An entity will take life point damage from falling from a great height in the following way:

**HEIGHT			ROLL VS	**

Less or equal to 10’	     1

11’ - 20’	     		     2

21’ - 30’			     3

31’ - 40’			     4

41’ - 50’			     5

51’ - 99’			Automatic

100’ +			Lose all LP


#### Healing

Healing wounds works reverse of damage, meaning that life points are healed first, then hero points. If a dying character is healed either by a priest or through a potion, that character will immediately gain a life point and become conscious.


##### NATURAL HEALING

Under normal circumstances, involving minimal or no medicinal care (and of course, excluding magical healing), characters and creatures recover 1 point of damage after each 8-hour full rest, in the order established above.

If a character is under the care of someone with a Medical background, this number increases to 2 points per day.


### Conditions

Not only can creatures receive damage reflected as hits, they can also be subject to different conditions that affect their health and can definitely endanger them in combat. Here are some common conditions, caused by combat results and magical effects.


#### Ablaze

If an entity has caught fire, and they move out of the source of fire, they will be ablaze for 1d6 rounds of combat. They will take damage for each round that the entity is on fire. If the entity spends one combat round stomping out the flames by any means (rolling on the ground, dousing with water, etc.), the fire will be put out immediately.


#### Afraid

The entity is absolutely scared and therefore unable to make logical decisions. Roll 1d6, and consult the following table for results:

**ROLL		RESULT**

1-2		Run away in a random direction.

3-4		Crawl away trying to hide.

5-6		Freeze up, 1 drop on all defense action rolls.


#### Exhausted

A creature that is exhausted is awake but moves at half speed due to exertion and tiredness, meaning that regularly it will take the creature two rounds to move a whole zone. An exhausted creature can attack and defend but will do so with 1 drop added to their roll, and no boosts can be applied, regardless of their existing boosts when out of the exhaustion condition.


#### Incapacitated

A creature with this condition is awake and aware, but cannot move or act at full capacity due to some ailment or damage received. An incapacitated creature does all actions with 3 drops.


#### Paralyzed

A stunned creature cannot act for a number of rounds that can vary based on the source of the condition. It is awake but cannot react to external actions, cannot move, talk or perform anything. Therefore, all attacks against it are automatic and are lethal hits.


#### Poisoned

Poison has a strength measured by a score between 1 and 5. For each combat round after being poisoned, the entity that is poisoned will have to roll 2d6 against the poison’s strength score. If the entity rolls lower than the poison’s score, they take one point of damage and will need to re-roll again on the next round. If they roll equal, no damage is taken but they must roll again on the next round. If they roll higher than the poison’s strength score, the poison has been neutralized, they take no damage, and they do not need to roll again.


#### Sick

An entity that is sick will perform all actions with 1 drop added to their rolls for as long as the sickness prevails, whether natural or magical in nature.


#### Unconscious

All attacks against an unconscious entity automatically hit and the target receives lethal damage. To be awakened, they need to roll a d6 against a set difficulty score between 1 and 5, based on the reason why the creature is unconscious. For example, if simply asleep they will only need to roll a 1 to wake up, while someone under some sort of chemical or magical unconsciousness might need to roll 4 or more.


### Action points

Each character class has a pool of Action Points (AP) available. These are used differently by each character class; for warriors and thieves, they are used to perform special combat maneuvers. For priests and wizards, it determines their spellcasting capacity.


#### Recovering action points

Unless otherwise specified, characters and creatures recover action points at a rate of 1 per combat round. However, there could be exceptions for certain monsters or future character classes.


#### Pushing

A character can consume more than the number of action points available to them, up to half their maximum AP. This is called _pushing_, as in pushing the limits of their abilities. In the right situation, it could be the difference between victory and defeat.

However, when a push happens, the character has over-exerted, and some conditions will apply. They will be under the condition of _exhaustion_ as long as its AP are below zero, and of course cannot use any of its abilities that require action points.

Once the character reaches zero AP, it is out of the exhaustion condition.


### Weapons

There are two types of weapons available for players, one-handed and two-handed. Weapon selection can be limited by character class and race. A weapon level determines how many boosts are added to the attack roll, therefore affecting its chances of inflicting direct Life Points to its target.


#### One-Handed

These weapons add 1 boost to Physical Action rolls. Examples of one-handed weapons are daggers, clubs, hand axes, longswords, slings, and morningstars.


#### Two-handed

These types of weapons add 2 boosts to Physical Action rolls. Examples of these are: Two-handed swords, bastard swords, flails, great axes, all bows and crossbows.


### Armor

Most character classes can wear armor to protect themselves from damage. Armor adds 1 boost to the wearer’s Physical Defense rolls. Any type of armor provides this boost, therefore, armor selection is more of an item of character appearance and characterization.


#### Shields

There’s only one type of shield available. A shield adds 1 boost to all of the defender’s rolls, both Physical Defense and Mental Defense.


## MONSTERS

Monsters and creatures don’t stick completely to the parameters previously established for player characters. Although they have all the same type of stats, skills and characteristics, monsters have more arbitrary scores and attributes, to show the diversity of size, power, and strength that can be found in the dungeons. Here are the statistics that define a monster.


### Monster stats

Statistics for monsters are presented as follows:



---


**Hobgoblin**

**Damage		**HP 3		LP 1

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 2		Defense 1

**Magical		**Action 1		Defense 1

**Attacks**		Weapon.



---



#### Damage

This section presents how many points of damage the creature can take. You have two scores: Hero Points (HP), and Life Points (LP).


#### Speed

This shows the movement speed of the creature in a combat round. It’s presented in zones. When a monster shows a movement of 0, that doesn’t mean that it can’t move, but rather that it moves only enough to cover a distance of around five feet. When the creature is unable to move, double dashes will be shown here.


#### Physical

This section shows the statistics used in physical combat, in the form of how many dice need to be rolled for the action being performed. If the number shown is followed by a negative sign, the roll being performed is dropped (thus, the lowest die is picked).


##### ATTACK

This is the number of dice rolled when performing a physical action for the monster.


##### DEFENSE

This presents the number of dice to be rolled for the defense roll when facing melee or missile combat, as long as it’s non-magical.


#### Magical

This section shows the statistics used in magical combat. Same as with the Physical section above, for the attack and defense modifiers shown, If the value shown is a positive value, boost the attack roll by that many dice.

If the number shown is a negative, drop the roll by the number indicated.  When a value of 0 is shown, that means that you just make a regular d6 roll for the monster.


##### ACTION

This is the total number of dice that must be rolled when performing a mental action for the monster. It applies when using any spellcasting abilities or when manipulating a magical device.


##### DEFENSE

This presents the dice that need to be rolled for the defense roll when the monster is the target of a magical attack.


##### ACTION POINTS (AP)

In the case of monsters that can cast magic, the total amount of available action points will be shown here. All monsters have a base spell cost of 1, and recover action points at the rate of 1 AP per round.


#### Attacks

This section describes the attacks available to the monster. If there’s a number and a description of an attack, it means that, on rolling that number, the monster will optionally perform that special attack instead of simply causing lethal damage.

## BESTIARY

Creatures wondrous and dangerous, marvelous or humble, diminutive or gigantic… They’re all found in this world. What follows is a list of some of these beasts and entities, information captured throughout the years by diligent adventurers and chroniclers, for the purpose of helping future adventurers as they follow their own perilous ventures...


## A


### Amaroq

**Damage		**HP 3		LP 1

**Speed		**2

**Physical		**Attack 3		Defense 1

**Magical		**Action --		Defense 1

**Attacks**		Claws, bite.

The amaroq is a formidable beast related to wolves. Unlike their more common counterpart, the amaroq is a solitary animal, preferring to wander and hunt by itself. However, amaroqs do have lairs where they go to rest after a long hunting session.

Amaroqs are nocturnal animals, preferring to use the stealth provided by darkness as a way to catch their prey. They possess incredible night vision, and because of this they are unaffected by dark environments.

The amaroq's appearance changes depending on its location. Those from cold, snowy regions have long, pure white fur, while those that live in forested areas tend to have shorter fur that goes from reddish brown to brown-grays.

They are fairly intelligent and have evolved to recognize humanoids as direct threats to their hunts and their environments. Therefore, an amaroq will not hesitate in attacking a group of humans as long as that group is not too large.


###


### Ant, giant

**Damage		**HP 3		LP 3

**Speed		**2

**Physical		**Attack 1		Defense 3

**Magical		**Action --		Defense 1

**Attacks**		Bite. 6: Carry victim away.

Vicious, fast, and incredibly tough just like their normal-sized counterparts, giant ants are about the size of a domesticated cat. They are a shiny blue-black color, and their bite is incredibly painful. On some occasions, they opt for carrying away their opponents, presumably to take them back to their lair and eat them.

Their underground lairs are an affair of complicated, impossible tunnels. A small creature like a halfling or a goblin could potentially crawl through these tunnels to find who knows what kind of strange treasure and objects.


### Ape, carnivorous

**Damage		**HP 4		LP 2

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 2		Defense 2

**Magical		**Action --		Defense 1

**Attacks**		Punch, bite. 6: body slam (stun).

They are nearly indistinguishable from their herbivore counterparts except for the large plume of coarse hair that sticks up from the top of their head to the middle of their back, and the huge canine teeth that protrude out like those of a sabertooth. Their fur ranges from a ruddy brown to black.

They are quite strong although not that agile, and one of their favorite ways to attack and capture their victims is to slam them with their whole bodies, stunning their prey, and then punching and biting their unfortunate prey until it dies.


### Assassin vine

**Damage		**HP 5		LP 1

**Speed		**0

**Physical		**Attack 1		Defense 1

**Magical		**Action --		Defense 1

**Attacks**		Slam. 4-6: grapple.

These appear as innocuous vines with lush green leaves and their characteristic, sweet-smelling, seven-petal lavender flowers. If a creature passes by them, they do not make any attempt to attack, unfortunately, in their natural habitat the vines tend to run all over the place, so the chances of someone stepping on the vines are rather high (1-4 on 1d6).

Once they detect a living being touching them, the vines immediately respond in a very aggressive manner, either slamming their victim with their thick, strong vines (around 1” thick), or trying to grapple and choke the victim to death.


## B


### Basilisk

**Damage		**HP 5		LP 2

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 2		Defense 2

**Magical		**Action --		Defense 2

**Attacks**		Bite, tail lashing. 6: paralyzing gaze.

A bizarre creature of obscure magical origins that looks like a black-feather rooster but with a body shaped like a snake, basilisks are dangerous creatures that tend to mind their own business but will undoubtedly charge and attack at the slightest threat.

Their eyes are a beautiful purple hue that contrasts beautifully against the black plumage; this beauty is in fact a lure for the basilisk’s victims, as its gaze can cause any creature to become paralyzed and defenseless.

When a paralysis attack is successful. The victim will be under the paralyzed condition for 1d6 rounds or until the condition is removed through medical or magical means.


### Bear, grizzly

**Damage		**HP 4		LP 3

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 3		Defense 1

**Magical		**Action --		Defense 1

**Attacks**		Claws, bite. 6: bear hug (grapple)

Grizzly bears, like most wildlife creatures, will generally stay away from the path of adventurers. However, if feeling threatened, they will not hesitate to attack and pursue anyone. Sometimes they will perform a bear hug and grapple a victim. In this situation a PA/PD contest will need to be rolled on every combat round, or else the victim takes one point of damage from the bear’s incredibly strong hug.


### Bee, giant

**Damage		**HP 0		LP 1

**Speed		**1, fly 2

**Physical		**Attack 1		Defense 2

**Magical		**Action --		Defense 1

**Attacks**		Sting.

A giant bee looks just like a regular bee but it’s roughly the size of a pigeon. When threatened, they will sting their victims, leaving the stinger embedded in the victim releasing a SL 1 poison that lasts for 1d6-2 rounds (minimum 1) or until the stinger is removed. After a successful attack, the bee will die.

Giant bees build amazing, giant beehives that can be more than 50 feet high, and their honey is quite prized and expensive. Unfortunately, trying to get this honey is a dangerous endeavor, as the bees will protect their hive at all costs.


### Boggart

**Damage		**HP 1		LP 1

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 1		Defense 2

**Magical		**Action 2		Defense 3

**Attacks**		Weapon.

The smallest members of the goblinoid family, boggarts are quite dainty, the tallest reaching around two feet in height. Their skin tends to be a lighter olive color, and they also tend to not have the characteristic skin spots nor the protruding tusks. Their bodies are quite skinny and wiry, but have proportionally longer legs than goblins.

Personality-wise, they tend to be more even-tempered than their bigger counterparts. Boggarts are fairly smart and are hard workers. They are hired frequently for household chores in farms, manors, and castles, especially since they can get into really tight places.

Boggarts have a mischievous side to them and can also drive a hard bargain. They tend to support each other more than other goblinoids and have a tighter culture, so when a boggart is slighted by someone, it is not uncommon for them to join forces and take revenge.


### Bugbear

**Damage		**HP 4		LP 2

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 3/4	Defense 2

**Magical		**Action 1		Defense 1

**Attacks**		One-handed/two-handed weapon.

Bugbears are the top echelon of the goblinoid family, and are highly intelligent and skilled, ferocious warriors. Tall, with some reaching more than 75 inches in height, muscular, and unlike other goblinoids, they’re covered with dark, very short fur, usually in a color that matches their skin, which ranges from grayish tan all the way to dark chocolate browns, although albinos are not that uncommon either. They have the characteristic outward-pointing ears of a goblin, but usually they cut them down considerably (as most of that extension is just plain cartilage that doesn’t affect hearing), or they wear thick hoop earrings at the pointy end of their ears, which then they tie together behind their heads with a leather strap to keep their ears away from damage in combat.

Bugbears have a traditional preference for axes in combat, with the stronger ones usually going all the way to a great axe. They prefer minimalistic combat wear as they consider regular armor limiting and, considering their natural fur, sometimes far too hot in battle.

For unknown reasons, magic doesn’t flow well through bugbears. Very few have had the willpower and sheer force to learn the arcane arts and become wizards. Ironically, these individuals become quite powerful due to their relentless dedication to the magical arts.


## C


### Centipede, giant

**Damage		**HP 1		LP 1

**Speed		**2

**Physical		**Attack 1		Defense 1

**Magical		**Action --		Defense 1

**Attacks**		Bite. 6: Venom.

You can usually hear them inside a dungeon with a characteristic continuous, quick tick-tick sound of their chitinous myriad legs tapping against hard stone floors. Giant centipedes are quick, vicious, and sometimes deadly. They are usually very dark brown or black, with some odd examples in dark green.

Their bite can sometimes be venomous (SL 2), which will cause the victim to become incapacitated, shivering on the ground until the effect passes away or is healed.


### Cobold

**Damage		**HP 1		LP 1

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 2		Defense 1

**Magical		**Action 1		Defense 2

**Attacks**		Weapon.

Usually reviled and rejected in society, cobolds are odd creatures with an unknown magical origin. Their skin is charcoal black and has a strange appearance similar to smooth carved wood. Their bodies are skinny and oddly bent, looking like a miniature human being with crooked claw-like fingers, and are no more than 36 inches in height. On the place where a humanoid would have their heart, cobolds have a strange, softly-glowing circle, betraying their arcane origins. They usually wear long (for them) cloaks to cover themselves and their glowing "heart".

Cobolds are known to make demands to towns, castles, and other types of residences and settlements for food and other things, even gold. If their demands are not met, they will usually assemble a mob and invade the place, crawling all over the buildings, going down chimneys, forcing their way in through windows and doors, attacking the people and stealing valuables from them.


## D


### Dragon

**Damage		**HP 10		LP 5

**Speed		**2, fly 5

**Physical		**Attack 4		Defense 3

**Magical		**Action 3		Defense 3	AP 8

**Attacks**		Bite, claws, tail whip. 5-6: breath weapon, spells.

Unique, powerful, dangerous, dragons are magnificent creatures of legend and lore. They can be symbols of justice and good as well as for evil and death. They are reptilian in nature, with giant wings, long tails, and powerful breath powers that can devastate large areas.


#### Aging

As dragons are able to live thousands of years, adventurers have a chance of meeting dragons of different ages, from young, barely-hatched ones, to adults at the peak of their power, to ancient, dying dragons. Each dragon age range has its own stats, as these stats apply to all types of dragons.

The following table shows how to modify the stats show for each dragon description, which are presented at the _adult_ age category, representing the peak performance level for the dragon. One exception to this natural decay is overall magical prowess; a dragon never stops growing in magical power, thus an ancient dragon will be able to cast amazing, powerful spells.

**AGE		HP	LP	PA	PD	MA	MD	AP**

**Hatchling**	-4	-2	-2	-2	--	-1	--

**Juvenile**		-2	-1	-1	-1	--	0	--

**Adult**		0	0	0	0	0	0	0

**Mature**		0	0	-1	-1	+1	0	+2

**Old**		-2	-1	-2	-2	+2	+1	+4

**Ancient**		-5	-3	-3	-2	+3	+2	+8


#### Scale Colors

Dragons are classified by the color of their scales, as these determine their location, temperament, magic field, and type of breath weapon. For playtesting purposes, all dragons have the same basic stats, with the difference being the breath weapon.

**COLOR		BREATH WEAPON ATTACK	MAGIC FIELD**

**Black**		Acid				Death

**Blue**		Lightning				Element

**Green**		Poisonous gas

**Red**		Fire				Element

**White**		Freezing air blast


## G


### Gargoyle

**Damage		**HP 3		LP 3

**Speed		**1, fly 2

**Physical		**Attack 2		Defense 3

**Magical		**Action --		Defense 2

**Attacks**		Claws, bite, horn.

Gargoyles are magical creatures made of stone, which means they must be the idea and creation of Erra, goddess of elements. They are relatively small generally, usually about 30 to 50 inches in height. They are squat with disproportionately thick bodies that belie their agility. Gargoyles usually wear grimacing faces with horrible, wide grins, and a multitude of horns on their heads, but they don’t necessarily have humanoid bodies, as some can have bodies that look like wolves, lizards, or birds of prey..

They regularly are used to guard buildings and entrances, simulating statues, unmoving and weathered by the elements. Therefore, they get 1 boost on their initiative rolls as they surprise any unwitting adventurers. Due to their stone skin, gargoyles are immune to slashing or stabbing attacks (as from a sword or an arrow), and can only take damage from bludgeoning weapons like maces, hammers, and such.


### Ghoul

**Damage		**HP 3		LP 1

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 2		Defense 2

**Magical		**Action 1		Defense 2

**Attacks**		Claws, bite.

Ghouls are unspeakably evil creatures who usually dwell in abandoned places by themselves. They do not have a specific appearance, as they adopt the appearance of their last victim. This cannot be confused with ghouls taking over their victim’s body, as some people think. As soon as their victim expires, they go through a pleasurable yet painful experience as their bodies completely transform and copy their victim’s.

However, they do not possess the victim’s memories. They are intelligent enough to attempt to act normally when planning and trying to capture a victim, as the ghoul might have learned a couple of mannerisms and expressions from their previous prey, therefore having a chance of passing undetected.


### Giant, Frost

**Damage		**HP 10		LP 5

**Speed		**2

**Physical		**Attack 4		Defense 2

**Magical		**Action 1		Defense 2

**Attacks**		Fist, kick, toss boulder.

Frost giants are the inhabitants of very tall, cold mountains. Their appearance is of a 20 to 25 feet tall, muscular human with pale blue skin and white hair and irises. Frost giants usually wear long mismatched furs and skins takes from different animals, and live to braid their hair and beards. They populate these remote areas in very large-scaled but primitive settlements. A typical frost giant settlement is composed of around 2d6 members, usually split evenly between males and females.

They are reserved and do not tend to interfere with the affairs of the external world, but they are fiercely territorial and will not hesitate to attack any invaders after a very brief warning.


### Goblin

**Damage		**HP 1		LP 1

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 1 	Defense 2

**Magical		**Action 1 		Defense 1

**Attacks**		Light weapon.

Goblins are small creatures about 36 inches tall. Their bodies are quite skinny and wiry, with gangly, thin arms and relatively short legs. Skin tones range from olive green to brown-black, and they also tend to have large freckles on their faces, backs, arms, and legs. Their eyes are usually a very intense yellow-amber, and their characteristic long ears extend a good six inches out horizontally from their heads. They have small tusks that protrude upward from their mouths.

They are well known for being excellent thieves and spies due to their natural agility and small size. They are also very courageous and sometimes even too brash, punching blindly above their weight sometimes. This makes them valuable companions but also an enemy that, even though not that strong, makes up for that in sheer determination.


### Griffin

**Damage		**HP 5		LP 2

**Speed		**2, fly 8

**Physical		**Attack 2		Defense 3

**Magical		**Action --		Defense 2

**Attacks**		Claws, bite. 6: Grab and lift.

Griffins are large, majestic creatures that have the oversized body of a lion with the head, wings, and claws of a giant eagle, and they can reach a length of 10 to 12 feet, not including the tail. Even though it's body is that of a lion, it is covered in soft, small feathers throughout. A griffin's plumage is usually very dark brown and black, with deep orange feathers at the outer edge of their wings and the end of the lion's tail. Their habitat is usually on tall, forested mountains in temperate climates, where they build large, impressive nests on sheer cliffs.

Their flight speed in combat is quite fast, and they are agile and nimble even when on the ground. This speed is part of the reason why they are fearsome in combat, in addition to their sharp claws and beak. Griffins are quite intelligent, and can have a basic understanding (but now speak) the common language of the region they inhabit. They possess an intrinsic sense of justice and will only attack if they feel threatened, or if they observe a creature bullying and abusing another one.

One of their more fearsome attacks is to grab a victim, take flight quickly, and drop them onto a hard surface to their death.


## H


### Hellhound

**Damage		**HP 5		LP 2

**Speed		**2

**Physical		**Attack 2		Defense 1

**Magical		**Action --		Defense 3

**Attacks**		Claws, bite. 6: Fire breath, 1 zone, single target.

These infernal, magical canine-like beasts look like giant mastiffs, their heads a solid six feet off the ground. Their skin has no fur, with a dark gray coloring that has a strange polished metal sheen to it. However, they are not made of metal at all. They are muscular, heavy-set, with cut-off tails, large silvery canine fangs, and glowing red eyes. They make an unsettling, incredibly deep growl.

Hellhounds are usually deployed to guard an area and prevent intruders from entering a protected area. They are faithful to their masters to death. However, there are known cases of “rogue” hellhounds that for some unknown reason are found wandering around aimlessly.

Their most fearsome attack is their fire breath, which can strike a target from more than 50 feet away, causing burns for 1d6 rounds or until the fire is put out.


### Hobgoblin

**Damage		**HP 3		LP 2

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 2		Defense 2

**Magical		**Action 1		Defense 1

**Attacks**		Weapon.

The larger cousin of goblins, hobgoblins are taller, more muscular, and are more adept at combat and other activities that require strenuous physical activity when compared to their smaller brethren. Other than that, in terms of appearance they are quite similar, with the same olive green to brown-black skin tones and large, dark freckles and spots on their bodies. Their eyes are yellow-amber, and their characteristic long ears extend about eight inches out horizontally from their heads. They have small tusks that protrude upward from their mouths. Their height usually ranges from 55 to 65 inches tall.

Hobgoblins have a natural tendency to be hot-headed and impulsive. But that does not mean they are not intelligent and capable. In fact, a seasoned hobgoblin warrior is a fearsome opponent for anyone. Like their larger cousins, the bugbears, they tend to prefer all sorts of axes for combat and don’t care much for metal armor.


##


## L


### Lizardfolk

**Damage		**HP 2		LP 2

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 1		Defense 2

**Magical		**Action 1		Defense 1

**Attacks**		Claws, bite, weapon.

Tall, lean, and rather impressive-looking, lizardfolk are tough, noble, and dependable people. Their bodies are covered with a thick reptilian skin, that ranges from colors like bright green and turquoise to deep greens and hazels. Their heads and faces are shaped like those of a gecko, and some have a crest on top of the head that can raise and lower at will. Lizardfolk also have long, strong tails that they can use as a weapon against their opponents.

Lizardfolk are amphibious, and as such can stay underwater for prolonged periods, and are very proficient, fast swimmers. They are also adept at fighting underwater, as this is usually part of the training they receive in their tribes.

They favor lighter armor and rely on the resiliency of  their skin. Lizardfolk favor spears and bows in combat. They have chosen to remain rather separated from most societies and settlements, but that doesn't mean that some manage to integrate into the population of large cities, and even though they guard their own settlements with zeal, they are welcoming to visitors.


## M


### Minotaur

**Damage		**HP 5		LP 3

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 4		Defense 2

**Magical		**Action 1		Defense 2

**Attacks**		Weapon, horns.

Minotaurs are amazingly strong creatures with a large human body but the head of a bull. They can reach heights of 96 inches, and are pure muscle and brute strength. Their bodies are covered in a very short fur similar to that of a bull, and ranges in color from dark reddish brown to black.

Minotaurs are fierce warriors and absolutely bearsome in combat. They handle two-handed weapons with ease, and are cunning and relentless in battle. They integrate well into regular society, and are admired for their hard-working ethics and courage. However, even though they have no problems with integration, they regularly migrate to their ancestral home, celebrating festivals to whom no person from any other species is invited.


### Mummy

**Damage		**HP 3		LP 3

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 1		Defense 1

**Magical		**Action --		Defense 2

**Attacks**		Claws. 6: Illness.

Mummies are undead entities who've gone through extensive physical and mystical rituals to preserve their bodies for eternity. The vast majority of mummies remain in their natural state of death. Occasionally the ritual performed doesn't do enough to appease the dead entity’s soul, which causes it to return to the material world as an undead entity by occupying their old body. They usually aim to take revenge on those who have caused them harm, finish an unaccomplished goal from their previous life, guard they ancestral home, or even as simple as keeping invaders away from their burial chamber.

Mummies are very single-minded in their purpose, and will be relentless and almost unstoppable in it. Due to their condition as corpses (even though preserved), mummies have a chance to inflict sickness on their victims. Anyone struck in such a way will be under the sick condition for 1d6 rounds or until healed by some means.

### Ogre

**Damage		**HP 7		LP 4

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 4		Defense 3

**Magical		**Action 1		Defense 1

**Attacks**		Weapon.

The human-like ogre is a species of incredible strength and size, usually reaching 120 to 140 inches in height. Their bodies tend to accumulate a lot of fat and, due to their size, that might give the impression that they are simply overweight, but under those layers of fat is pure muscle that is stronger than that of almost any humanoid.

Their heads are rather large in proportion to their bodies, with very thick necks, making them look like their head just protrudes straight off of their shoulders. Their hair tends to be rather sparse and stringy, even for the females. Their faces have brutish, strong features, with a protruding brow, large hawk-like noses, and disproportionately large mouths. Their rounded ears are quite small in comparison to the rest of their features.

Their bodies are not that good at controlling their temperature, so ogres enjoy bathing in mud and keeping their bodies covered in dried mud, as this helps them keep their body temperature at a comfortable level. This is part of the reason why they wear barely any clothing, with many opting for simply being naked all the time. They have a preference from eating raw meat, and will not hesitate in eating other humanoids if they can.


### Orc

**Damage		**HP 4		LP 2

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 3		Defense 2

**Magical		**Action 1		Defense 2

**Attacks**		Weapon.

Orcs are, together with bugbears and dwarves, arguably the best melee warriors on the battlefield. Fierce, master of two-handed weapons, and a naturally high resistance to magical attacks makes confronting an orc something to be seriously considered.

Their skin ranges from dark to light sepia-gray, with prominent body hair throughout in the same pattern as humans. Their mouths have two large, upward-protruding fangs which they like to adorn with gold rings and other pieces of jewelry.  Their eyes tend to be small and mostly black, although rarely you can find an individual with brown or even hazel eyes. Hair color is mostly shades of brown and black. They love braiding their hair in complicated patterns.

Orcs have a very complex culture, with many superstitions, and even as they integrate with society even in large cities, and achieve high positions in them (especially in the military), this integration is somewhat of a recent happening, and for that reason they are adamant about remembering their origins and will sometimes perform certain small rituals (like moving their hand in a certain pattern after closing a business deal) that reflect those old beliefs.


## P


### Piskie

**Damage		**HP 1		LP 1

**Speed		**2, fly 4

**Physical		**Attack 1		Defense 2

**Magical		**Action 2		Defense 2	AP 4

**Attacks**		Weapon, spell (Deceit).

Piskies are clever and naughty fey creatures that are tiny, mischievous, and quite strong in their magical powers considering their small size of no more than 12 inches in height. They are often ill-clothed or naked, but they have a preference for bits of finery, like silk ribbons and small precious stone earrings. They look like tiny halflings, with very skinny bodies. Their skin tones are the same as those of most humanoids, ranging from pale tan to dark brown. The have bat-like wings which allow them to fly and dart around like hummingbirds.

Some piskies are said to steal children or to lead travellers astray. They are drawn to horses, riding them for pleasure and making tangled ringlets in the manes of those horses they ride. They are great explorers familiar with the caves of the ocean, the hidden sources of the streams and the recesses of the land, so if adventurers are able to befriend or negotiate with a piskie, they could gain a worthy guide. However, as mentioned above, some piskies cannot resist the chance of tricking adventurers and taking advantage of them.

### Rat, giant

**Damage		**HP 1		LP 1

**Speed		**2

**Physical		**Attack 1		Defense 1

**Magical		**Action --		Defense 3

**Attacks**		Claws, bite. 6: Illness.

Giant rats are just like their normal counterparts but about 48 inches in length. They are sneaky, sometimes aggressive, and will definitely eat through materials, opening their way into unwanted places. Sometimes they can transmit illness with their bite; in the case that happens, the victim will be under the Sick condition for 2d6 rounds.


## S


### Shrieker

**Damage		**HP 0		LP 1

**Speed		**0

**Physical		**Attack --		Defense 1

**Magical		**Action --		Defense 1

**Attacks**		None, shriek when harmed, 2 zone range.

Shriekers are rather large mushrooms that grow in thick clusters. The tops are reddish purple, and are pockmarked with myriad holes similar to a lotus blossom. They range from 12 to 36 inches in diameter, and grow from 24 to 60 inches in height. The stalks are an off-white color and quite thick.

These mushrooms are harmless per se, and you can make a fantastic tea out of them. However, if they detect movement nearby, the shriekers feel threatened, filling a set of internal bellows in their stalks and producing a high-pitched, shrieking sound (thus their name) that will blow the cover of any unfortunate adventurers that come across them.

There’s a 1-4 in 1d6 chance of a nearby creature becoming attracted to the shrieking sound.


### Skeleton

**Damage		**HP 4		LP 1

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 1		Defense 2, 1 against blunt weapons.

**Magical		**Action --		Defense 2

**Attacks**		Weapon.

Brought from eternal rest by the occult powers of Death magic, skeletons are a type of undead creature that is usually created for a very specific warfare-related purposes: guard a hall, patrol an area, or used as unwavering, faithful soldiers.

Skeletons are not smart, and will follow whatever orders they are given in an unwavering manner, even if it means their utter destruction. Death priests and wizards usually invoke them as a relatively inexpensive way to defend an area, especially at places that are far away or difficult to get to..

They have a natural weakness against blunt weapons, which lowers their physical defense by 1 drop when attacked with that type of weapon. Note that bare fists do not count as blunt weapons for this purpose, as they don’t carry enough power when they hit.


### Snake, giant rattlesnake

**Damage		**HP 2		LP 1

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 2		Defense 2

**Magical		**Action --		Defense 1

**Attacks**		Bite. 5+: venom.

A giant rattlesnake is about 25 feet long, with the familiar patterns that identify the regular members of this species. They also have the dreaded rattle at the end of their tail which gives these snakes their unique name. In the case of the giant rattlesnake, it’s a very loud, lower-pitched sound that sends shivers down the spine of any seasoned adventurer.

Sometimes the attack of a rattlesnake will allow it to inject its venom into a victim. This venom lasts for 1d6 rounds, and the victim will be under the poisoned condition for that length of time unless healed.


### Spider, giant

**Damage		**HP 3		LP 1

**Speed		**2

**Physical		**Attack 2		Defense 2

**Magical		**Action --		Defense 1

**Attacks**		Bite. 6: grapple & web.

Giant spiders are found in dark, hidden areas in abandoned dungeons and castles, and also in caves throughout the world. They range from 24 to 48 inches in size, with black or blue-black coloring, and have short, stiff hairs covering their bodies in an almost spike-like way.

They are quite aggressive and territorial and will attack on sight. On some occasions they will grapple an opponent and use their web to wrap them in it. A victim in this situation is considered to be under the incapacitated condition. A spun web will have a strength score from 1 to 5. Victims need to roll a successful physical defense on every round to break free from the web.


## T


### Topiar

**Damage		**HP 6		LP 3

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 2		Defense 4

**Magical		**Action 1		Defense 2

**Attacks**		Branches, fists

Topiars are living trees, usually about 10 to 20 feet in height. When resting, they look just like any other tree, with thick barks and lush foliage, although not as wide on top as a regular tree. However, when woken up, the trunk separates into two legs, and their head and arms seem to sprout out of their foliage.

They are generally gentle creatures with a calm demeanor and the wisdom of hundreds of years of life, but they are fierce defenders of their surroundings, and will unhesitantly attack anyone who willfully harms their forest home.


### Troll

**Damage		**HP 6		LP 4

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 4		Defense 2

**Magical		**Action 1		Defense 1

**Attacks**		Weapon.

Large, imposing, and deadly, trolls are found all over the world, usually living in isolation, as independence is highly valued in their culture. A typical troll will be around 9 to 12 feet tall, with very muscular, human-like thick bodies. Their hands have only four fingers, and their feet four toes. They tend to be hairy in the same patterns a human can be. Their skin goes from dark gray-brown to pale gray. Usually, the darker-skinned trolls are found in the tropical areas, while skins get gradually lighter as you move into colder regions.

Trolls do not get along with any other species, and basically consider everything else that moves as possible food. They are quite aggressive, will fight with berserker rage, but are not very clever. Negotiating with a troll can become an exercise in futility, as they are very stubborn.


## V


### Vestige

When deities directly interfere in the world in one way or another (as opposed to the manifestation of magic through spells or magical devices), rifts and distortions in the fabric of reality in the physical world provoke manifestations, fragments of raw divine power, that take shape in diverse ways. These manifestations are known as vestiges.

Vestiges capture the essence of the magic field that particular deity manipulates and masters. The strength of such manifestation is variable, and takes different shapes depending on its strength and the type of magic that is involved.

When fighting against vestiges, spells and magical items that belong to the vestige's diametric magic automatically gain one boost on their actions against vestiges. Conversely, spells and magical items that belong to the same magic as the vestige's origin receive one drop on their actions.

To randomly find out the origin of a vestige, roll 2d6 and consult the table below.

**ROLL		MAGIC FIELD**

2		Life

5		Element

6-8		Roll again, or choose one.

#### Essence

**Damage		**HP 2		LP 1

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 1		Defense 1

**Magical		**Action 2		Defense 2	AP 1d6+2

**Attacks**		Single spell based on magic field.

An essence vestige represents a single characteristic or aspect of the magic field they belong to. They tend to be completely incorporeal or adopt other semi-physical forms, with a physical manifestation and consistency ranging from cloud-like all the way to something akin to heavy grease, plasma, or other forms. They are extremely intelligent and decently powerful, although their magic is limited to whatever single aspect they represent.

For example, an Element essence might be akin to a floating, swirling fireball, or a Death essence could be something as simple as dark, wispy clouds.

Based on the essence’s magic field, you can randomly roll for the spell that it will channel and use. Roll 1d6 and consult the applicable table below. You can also give the essence any spell, including GM (or player) created spells, as long as it is within the magic field’s context.

#### Incarnate

**Damage		**HP 6		LP 3

**Speed		**1

**Physical		**Attack 2		Defense 3

**Magical		**Action 3		Defense 2	AP 1d6 + 8

**Attacks**		Weapon, spells.

A powerful entity that is a physical embodiment of a single magic field. When this force is released in the physical plane, it wanders around the world at insane speeds, ricocheting among living creatures until it stumbles upon an appropriate creature to act as a vessel to hold on to its power. They take over existing creatures, usually humanoids, and become a strange mix of the carnal and the divine, mixing characteristics from both planes of existence. Therefore their appearance changes, and the old personality of the individual is lost forever, consumed by the raw divine power that has taken over.

Incarnates are cunning and tend to be dangerous, as they tend to mix their incredibly strong magical prowess with the mental pitfalls of material creatures; therefore things like greed, lust, and avarice tend to take hold of them. Sometimes they might, in fact, think they are doing something good for the world, unable to see their errors through the madness.


#### Paragon

**Damage		**HP 10		LP 6

**Speed		**2

**Physical		**Attack 4		Defense 4

**Magical		**Action 4		Defense 4	AP 1d6+12

**Attacks**		Spells.

A paragon vestige is transcendental and extremely powerful, closer to what we consider a demigod. They are the actual manifestation of a deity's power, a being that is half raw divine magic power and half celestial entity. When a deity exercises their power directly, this is what actually comes out of the celestial essence of the deity to perform their desired tasks.

They are unerringly obedient to their masters to a fanatical extent, and will pursue the goals of their deity even when they accidentally remain trapped in this plane of existence. However, it is rumored by some priests that sometimes deities leave paragons on purpose on the physical plane, but to what end or purpose it is unknown.

An encounter with a paragon should never be taken lightly, even for priests of the same magic field. In their fanatical devotion, paragons end up having a possibly distorted view of reality and misunderstand for the most part the world that surrounds them. That can make their reactions hard to gauge and predict.

Their powers are almost god-like, and are highly resistance to most types of damage.

## CREATING NEW MONSTERS

If you want to create your own monsters, especially since this is a Playtest Edition of the game with only a few of them listed, here are some guidelines that will give you an idea on how to design your own wondrous beasts. For this, let’s revisit monster statistics and see how we can manipulate those to design a monster that fits our view.


#### Damage capacity

For this, we can use the basic warrior as a measuring stick on how many hero points and life points we’ll assign to the beast. Starting off, the warrior character class is not intended to be as low-powered as what usually is a first level character in your typical RPG system. It’s expected that a warrior (and indeed, all the other classes) start off as a mid-low level adventurer.

 

As a way to illustrate this, if we used a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being a total newbie and 10 being a warfare expert, a character starts off as a 3. Knowing this, now we have a good idea on where to start.

A warrior starts in its most basic form with 4 hero points and 3 life points., which means that if you want to create a monster weaker than a regular warrior, it’s as easy as assigning less hero points and life points to your creation. But what do those scores represent?


##### Hero Points

These represent a combination of physical endurance with sheer willpower and motivation. It determines how much damage someone can take and ignore to a certain extent. Losing hero points doesn’t kill someone outright, but it does weaken the player or creature, leading to an eventual death.


##### Life Points

You can think of life points as the actual bodily resistance to damage of the creature. That’s why losing all life points inevitably leads to death. Thus, lethal damage caused by solid weapon hits, spells, or an accident, will cause the character or creature to take life point damage directly.


##### Application in monster design

This means that if, for example, we intend to create a monster that is extremely tough and resistant to damage, the amount of life points will be rather high. Keep in mind that life points can never be higher than hero points.

On the other hand, we could be creating a monster that possesses a lot of willpower and courage in fighting, but in reality  is rather weak physically. This monster could have a relatively high amount of hero points, but probably only two or one life points.


#### Speed

A regular player character moves 1 zone per combat round, which is about 25-30 feet. Based on this, make a calculation and estimating how quick the creature is, establish a base speed, measured in zones.

If the monster possesses an additional method of movement, like flying, assign a (usually higher) value for this.


#### Attack and defense rolls

These show how many dice to roll for attack and defense rolls, physical and magical. Again, base your numbers on the typical warrior, which usually will have a PA of 3, and a PD of 2.

Magical actions don’t count for creatures that cannot wield magical devices or cast spells, so no need to set up a score for that. However, all creatures have at least a MD score of 1.


#### Top die roll

By default, the top die roll for inflicting direct lethal damage is 6. You can choose to lower these threshold to 5 if you consider that the monster should be dangerous and powerful enough to warrant such a huge advantage.

Optionally, you can also add some sort of special effect to the top damage roll: poison, grapple, or any other effect that applies.


#### Attacks

What kind of attacks does this monster perform? It might be as simple as a weapon or a bite attack, or something more complicated as an attack, such as entangling the victim, or poisoning. You can also have a special attack that is triggered by the monster’s top roll; usually that would be its most deadly strike.

## CHARACTER GROWTH

As characters become more experienced through constant adventuring, they will become better at what they do, just like it happens with people in real life. This gives players something to look forward to as they keep adventuring and exploring the dangerous world they live in, knowing that they will become more powerful as time goes by.


### Measuring progress

Progress and advancement is measured by the number of successful experiences (SX) that a player character survives, which works somewhat as a mix between the classic experience point system, and the more modern milestone progress system.

Note that evaluating what counts as a valid SX depends on the judgment of the Game Master, but there are basic guidelines that they can follow to award these appropriately.


#### What counts as an SX?

In its most basic form, an encounter which involves a combat situation and is survived by the character will count as a valid SX for measuring character progress. Just keep in mind that the encounter has to be at least a moderate challenge; four player characters piling on a single lone kobold will surely not count as a SX, at least not by itself.

Also, combat doesn’t necessarily has to end in a total defeat of the enemy to be considered successful. Negotiating and convincing opponents to stop fighting, as well as smartly retreating from a far too powerful enemy (after putting in some effort) can also be considered as SX for progress.

Big, important resolutions achieved through role-playing, solving a huge puzzle, saving the lives of some villagers, and other heroic actions can also be given to the player characters as SX.


### Measuring growth

To demonstrate growth in a palpable way that affects gameplay in a way advantageous to the player, some aspects of the character are modified as time goes on and they gain more SX.


#### Action points

Action points are used for special maneuvers and for casting spells. For every 5 SX gained by a player character, they gain 1 extra AP for their pool.


#### Hero Points

For every 10 SX gained by the player character, their hero point count will increase by 1.


#### Life Points

For every 20 SX gained by the player character, their life point count will increase by 1.


#### New background

As an optional measure of growth, and usually at the end of an adventure, the Game Master might want to grant one or more player characters an additional background based on the adventure they’ve completed. For example, if in the adventure the players spent a very large amount of time on a seafaring ship, the GM might want to give the characters a Sailor background.




## DESIGNING ADVENTURES

Perilous Ventures is designed to work with the theater-of-the-mind (TOTM) style for combat and adventuring. This makes preparations for the Game Master very easy, since there’s no need for detailed maps with to-scale measurements.


### Zone maps

This system, with its emphasis on theater of the mind play style, uses a simplified type of map for adventures, called a zone map. This type of map is closer to a diagram or flowchart than to an actual map, and it greatly simplifies the adventure creation process. This is not something original to this system; zone maps have been used even in systems with precise distance measurements such as _Dungeons & Dragons 5e_.

As an example on how to write your zone maps, we will be using a regular, gridded map as a starting point and use that as a base on which we will write the map using the simplified mapping system. This way it’ll be easier for you to understand the concepts behind zone maps.


### Creating an adventure map

This is a map for a very simple, one-shot adventure that takes place in a single-floor abandoned temple in the middle of a sinuous, cold, windy mountain road, surrounded by barren rocks and sheer cliffs.



<p id="gdcalert3" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Perilous-Ventures2.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert4">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Perilous-Ventures2.png "image_tooltip")


Although this is a rather simple map, it can be further simplified if we represent it like this:



<p id="gdcalert4" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Perilous-Ventures3.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert5">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Perilous-Ventures3.png "image_tooltip")


Now we’re not even bothering with measurements, or shapes. We can quickly diagram a layout that will essentially perform the same function as the grid map, but it’s much easier to draw and arguably is easier to read. Here’s how.


#### Describing a map area

We can structure an area description using the following sections: size, appearance, scene, and optionally, monsters and people.


##### SIZE

There’s some information that is “lost” when moving towards a zone map, and that is detailed room size information.  This can easily be annotated on the map notes if needed. But instead of writing down exact room measurements, you can write down the dimensions in terms of zones (see the section _Move_ under _Events_).

In the _Combat > Events_ section above, we learned that zones are around 25’ in size in any direction. A room’s size is relevant only in relation to character and monster movement. Therefore, in a combat round, a character will be easily able to move freely in a room that is 25’ or less in size. If a room is bigger than that, then you know it is 2 zones in size, and a character _might_ need more than one round to move to one extreme to the other.

The word _might_ needs to be emphasized, because this depends on how big you’ve imagined the room to be and where the character is located at that point in time. This is where theater of the mind comes into play.

It’s up to you as the Game Master to judge if the character could move to one of the room’s walls in one round. To illustrate with actual distances, if a character is in a room that is 2 zones wide, but it’s in the middle of the room at that moment, it could easily reach the walls on either the left or right sides, since it would actually me a 1 zone move.

For more detailed notes, you could write down width, length and height zone size for rooms. For example, in the case of our Temple of Gan map, you could represent the main hall’s size--which is on the map 40’ wide, by 20’ long, and 15’ tall--simply as W2, L1, H1.


##### APPEARANCE

Traditionally, room descriptions are detailed in a narrative form. Some game modules even go as far as having a highlighted section that's to be read to the players.

Writing this kind of prose can be a bit daunting. However, there's an easier way to write up room descriptions, and that is to split the room's characteristics in the five senses: sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch.

Instead of writing paragraphs of descriptions, write bullet points for each sense. We recommend you start with sight, as it's usually the very first thing we perceive when walking into an area. Then continue on with the other senses as required. If the room doesn't need a particular sensory description, like taste, simply skip that item from the description.


##### SCENE

What is happening in this room? Are there monsters lurking and waiting to attack the heroes? Is there a trap? Or will they find an important NPC in this area? All these questions are answered in this section. You will also note here any information that might be for your eyes only, like what will happen if one of the heroes pulls that lever on the far wall.


##### MONSTERS

If needed, we can add a section for any monsters that will be found in this room by the heroes. Use the simple linear notation to write in the monsters’ stats and information, including how many of these are found in the area.


##### PEOPLE

It might be that the heroes might find other people in the room, like a prisoner, a lost adventurer, or a stalking thief. Write down the information for the NPC in this area, using the linear notation used for them.


### Putting it all together

Now knowing how to describe a room in the adventure, let’s see how that first room of the map shown above can look:


#### Main Nave


##### Size



*   W2, L1, H1


##### Appearance



*   **Sight:** Dust everywhere, light enters through broken stained glass windows, worn out and scratched pews on both sides of the room.
*   **Sound:** Every sound echoes throughout the area. Sound of dripping water.
*   **Smell:** Dust, mildew, decaying flesh.


##### Scene



*   There are a few kobolds here resting and not really paying attention to their surroundings. A couple of them are eating some nondescript food, and the others are having a conversation in hushed tones.


##### Monsters



*   **4 Kobolds:** HP 1, LP 1, Speed 1, PA 1, PD 2, MA 1, MD 1, Attack: Weapon.


#### Why use this system?

With these brief descriptions in bullet point format, you can embellish the description of the room in your own words. It allows for a more spontaneous and vibrant way to tell the story and describe the world for your players. You can also decide which aspect of the room the players get to hear first; it might be for example, that the smell of a certain room is the first thing they notice as they arrive. It’s up to the Game Master to prioritize this to the best effect.

One of the things that players will find and seek while they’re adventuring is magical items. These can be magic-imbued weapons, staves, rods, scrolls, and potions, all of them with a particular magical effect.


### Creating magic items

The process of creating a magical items is as simple as establishing certain aspects of it, and adding a little bit of flourish and grandeur as a final touch.


#### Item types

The very first aspect to define is what type of item it is. Is it a weapon, like a longsword? Is it a scroll? A potion? Think of what you want to achieve with this magical item, and based upon that select the best option for your game.

The item type also defines which character class can use it, as explained in the following table.

##### ARMOR

Armor can be enchanted to provide more protection, or it can cause certain magical effects upon the wearer, or the creatures surrounding the wearer.


##### POTION

A potion is a chemical preparation in liquid form, which bestows the drinker (and sometimes just by pouring it over someone or something) with some sort of magical effect.


##### ROD

A rod is usually some sort of decorated or gilded stick, about 18 to 24 inches in length, and sometimes decorated with some sort of jewels or metals at the top, looking similar to a mace. Rods usually have permanent magical effects associated with them.


##### SCROLL

A scroll is a piece of parchment or other type of paper that contains an incantation in written form. Reading this scroll out will cause the magical effect in it to take effect, and the scroll itself to burn up quickly and become unusable, therefore scrolls are single-use items.


##### SHIELD

A magic-imbued combat shield will provide an effect like increased protection from a regular shield, or might have some other effects on the wearer, or the surrounding creatures.


##### STAFF

A staff is usually much longer than a rod, from 48 to 72 inches in length, and similar to rods, they can be richly decorated, although they can be very plain and simple too.

Staves usually have permanent magical effects imbued into them, although this doesn’t have to be the case necessarily. They can also be used as basic bludgeoning weapons if needed, like a quarterstaff.


##### WAND

These are thin sticks, usually 12 to 18 inches in length, light and portable. A wand can be used multiple times like rods and staves, however, most of the time they have a limited set of charges imbued into them.


##### WEAPON

These are just combat weapons that have been imbued with some magical property. They can cause a particular effect, or just simply provide bonuses when attacking opponents. Note that magical weapon usage is still limited by the character’s class; therefore, a wizard cannot use a magical longsword, for example.


##### WEARABLE

This includes things like rings, bracelets, necklaces, medallions, robes, and cloaks. Basically anything that can be worn as


#### Magic field

As anything else related to magic in this game, you must choose a magic field for the item. Choose from any one of the ten magic fields available.


#### Effects

Choose from one to three magical effects for the item. Most regular magic items will have just one magical effect. More powerful devices will probably have more than one effect.

Remember that the effects have to tie in directly with the magic field chosen, as this keeps consistency within the system, plus it becomes a very important characteristic for priests when wielding these devices.


#### Usage

Magical items can have a permanent effect, or a limited set of uses, either on a daily basis or throughout its lifetime.


##### PERMANENT

Things like magical armor, shields, or wearables usually have permanent effects attached to them. For example, a Leather Armor of Preservation that provides a permanent boost for Physical Defense rolls, or a Bow of Truth that receives a permanent boost to Physical Action rolls performed with it.


##### LIMITED

There are two ways to handle magical items that have limited usage. The first method is to have the item possess a set number of uses per day.

The second way to handle it is to have the item has a set number of uses for its lifetime. This is usually applied to smaller items like wands, although the magical effects chosen tend to be more powerful to balance out this disadvantage.

Some items will have a single use, like potions, which need to be drunk fully to get the desired effect.


#### Description

Finally, stop for a second and dream up a fantastic appearance for the device. Does it glow? Is it intricately engraved with gold and silver? Is it made out of a strange blue wood? Let your imagination run wild!

You can also think of a name for the device, especially if it’s rather powerful or special.


### Sample magical items

Here are a few examples of magical items that could be found in your adventures. You can use these items, or study them so that you can create your very own magical devices for your adventures.

## ACTION ROLL PROBABILITIES

As a way to help Game Masters estimate danger, difficulty, and other factors that are important when running a game, here are the raw probability percentages for rolling the highest numbers depending on how many drops or boosts the roll has.
