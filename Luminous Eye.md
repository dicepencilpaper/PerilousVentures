# The Luminous Eye

## Overview

An elder lady comes to the heroes, asking for help to retrieve an important device she claims was stolen from her, the **Luminous Eye**, a powerful, glowing orb that holds some sort of powers. She declares that this stone was taken from her home by a group of cobolds that tried to coerce her into a deal, which she refused.

She is offering 50 GP for retrieving this device for her.

### The cobolds

The cobolds live in the forests north of your home, the **City of Tospia**. in the wide-ranging **Red Forest**. They are odd creatures of an unknown magical origin. Their skin is charcoal black and has a strange appearance similar to smooth carved wood. Their bodies are skinny and oddly bent, looking like a miniature human being with crooked claw-like fingers, and are no more than 36 inches in height. On the place where a humanoid would have their heart, cobolds have a strange, softly-glowing circle, betraying their arcane origins. They usually wear long (for them) cloaks to cover themselves and their glowing "heart".

### The Luminous Eye

A small piece of glass imbued with magical light, the Luminous Eye is a six-inch ring of copper with two ear-like handles on opposite sides. In the center of the device is an augmentation glass that makes things look larger. When held by both handles, the device illuminates around the rings, lighting whatever is being looked at through the lens, and more importantly, translating any language or runes into a language the device holder's can read.
